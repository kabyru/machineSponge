[Following the SpongeBob SquarePants theme song, the brief opening titles show the names of creator Stephen Hillenburg, Derek Drymon and others. The episode opens with a bubble transition, and we see a coral reef under the sea. The camera zooms to initiate parallax scrolling, which reveals the city of Bikini Bottom. It continues zooming to show a brown rock, a Moai head, and a pineapple, which each contain inhabitants.]
French Narrator: Ah, the sea... so fascinating. So wonderful. Here, we see Bikini Bottom, teeming with life. [Shows from left to right Patrick's, Squidward's, and SpongeBob's houses. Zooms in on SpongeBob's house.] Home to one of my favorite creatures, SpongeBob SquarePants. Yes, of course he lives in a pineapple, you silly. [Scene cuts to the house's bedroom. A sea snail is seen sleeping near a pile of newspapers on the floor, a scallop is seen in a birdcage, and a young, optimistic sea sponge is seen sleeping in his bed, snoring as his foghorn alarm clock ticks. SpongeBob's alarm then sounds. He wakes, but is unaffected by the annoying sound, and with a smile on his face, turns it off. He climbs from his bed to a ladder, leading to his diving board.]
SpongeBob: Today's the big day, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [jumps on the diving board] Look at me, I'm... [jumps up, and leaves his underwear behind] ...naked! [Lands inside pants, walks over to exercise room. His head pops out of the top of his pants.] Gotta be in top physical condition for today, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He goes inside his small gym room that has a sign that reads "I Love Pain." Taking deep breaths, he prepares to lift a barbell that is balanced by two lightweight stuffed animals. He sticks out his chest, but almost passes out because he can barely lift it. He drops it, and it makes a "squeak" noise] I'm ready! [runs outside] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! [A dimwitted sea star's rock tilts upwards with him stuck to its underside]
Patrick: Go, SpongeBob! [Patrick falls] Whoa! [crash sound effect]
SpongeBob: [runs down the street to the Krusty Krab] There it is. The finest eating establishment ever established for eating: The Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. With a Help Wanted sign in the window. For years I've been dreaming of this moment. I'm gonna go in there, march straight to the manager, look 'im straight in the eye [breaks the fourth wall and looks the audience in the eye], lay it on the line and... I can't do this! [He starts to run home, but Patrick stops him.] Uh, Patrick!
Patrick: Where do you think you're going?
SpongeBob: I was just...
Patrick: No you're not. You're going to the Krusty Krab and get that job.
SpongeBob: I can't, don't you see? I'm not good enough.
Patrick: Whose first words were "May I take your order"?
SpongeBob: Mine were.
Patrick: Who made a spatula out of toothpicks in wood shop?
SpongeBob: I did.
Patrick: [grimaces and contorts twice while trying to come up with a good third line] Who's a, uh, who's uhh, oh! Who's a big yellow cube with holes?
SpongeBob: I am.
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Patrick: Who's ready?
SpongeBob: I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. An octopus is seen cleaning graffiti on the restaurant's windows.]
Squidward: [cleaning graffiti of himself with the word "loser," sees SpongeBob, and sighs] Oh no, SpongeBob. What could he possibly want?
SpongeBob: [in background, at first while Squidward was talking] I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob! Go, self! [Squidward looks at the Help Wanted sign, screams, and runs inside.]
Squidward: [While SpongeBob says, "I'm ready," one more time in the background] Mr. Krabs! [cuts to the ordering window, where a greedy crab is seen happily sniffing a handful of money. Squidward runs up to him.] Hurry, Mr. Krabs, before it's too late, I gotta tell you- [interrupted by SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard, captain. [deep voice] I've been training my whole life for the day I could join the Krusty Krew [normal voice] and now I'm ready. [SpongeBob trips on a nail stuck in the floorboard. Mr. Krabs and Squidward look at each other. His fall causes him to bounce against the ceiling. SpongeBob shouts and blurts incomprehensibly while his bounces and ricochets around the building accelerate. He then rolls to a stop at the feet of Squidward and Mr. Krabs.] So, uh, when do I start?
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, it looks like you don't even have your sea legs.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, please. I'll prove I'm fry cook material. Ask Squidward, he'll vouch for me. [Mr. Krabs and Squidward quickly walk away from SpongeBob]
Squidward: [deep breath] No. [Mr. Krabs winks. They head back to SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Well, lad, we'll give you a test, and if you pass, you'll be on the Krusty Krew. Go out and fetch me... [SpongeBob takes out a notepad] a, uh, hydrodynamic spatula... [SpongeBob quickly jots down what he says] with, um, port-and-starboard-attachments, [more scribbling] and, uh... turbo drive. [more scribbling] And don't come back ‘til you get one. [Mr. Krabs puts a Krusty Krab crew hat on SpongeBob's head. SpongeBob sees how he looks in a mirror, there are sparkles on his hat, and he has a huge, satisfied smile]
SpongeBob: [saluting Krabs] Aye aye, captain! [reading] One hydrodynamic spatula, with port-and-starboard attachments, turbo drive, coming right up, Sir!
Mr. Krabs: Carry on! [SpongeBob leaves] We'll never see that lubber again.
Squidward: You're terrible. A hydro-what? [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh. While Squidward laughs, his nose moves distinctly while he inhales and exhales. Krabs laugh sounds like a pirate. As they laugh, SpongeBob is shown leaving the Krusty Krab. As SpongeBob fades out of sight, five buses drive toward the Krusty Krab from the opposite direction.]
Bus driver: Hey! Hey! Please! Passengers are to stay seated and not put their hands out the window! [The buses surround the Krusty Krab and the doors open; Mr. Krabs stops laughing.]
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] That sounded like hatch doors. [sniffs repeatedly] Do you smell it? That smell. A kind of smelly smell. A smelly smell that smells... smelly. [his eyes widen] Anchovies.
Squidward: What?
Mr. Krabs: Anchovies! [Anchovies get out of the buses and rush inside the Krusty Krab, crowding, repeating the word "meep" over and over again]
Squidward: Please, please, quiet! [anchovies stop talking] Is this any way to behave, hmmm?
Anchovy: Meep!
Squidward: Could we show a little decency and form a neat, single file line in front of the register? [The anchovies stare for a moment, then pick up the boat, as their cries of "meep!" become more intense. Cut to Barg'N-Mart as SpongeBob enters.]
SpongeBob: [singing to himself] ♪ Barg'N-Mart, meeting all of your spatula needs. ♪ [cuts back to the Krusty Krab. Squidward and Mr. Krabs are still in the boat register, and being tossed around like a ship in a storm.]
Mr. Krabs: All hands on deck! Get your anchors out of your pants!
Squidward: One single file line was all I asked!
Mr. Krabs: Whoa! [Mr. Krabs and Squidward are thrown up in the air] Batten down the hatches, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again; the boat is in splinters] We're taking on water, Mr. Squidward! [they get thrown back up again, with Krabs clutching Squidward] I want my mommy, Mr. Squidward! [cuts to Barg'N-Mart]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪ Do do do do do do, spatula, spatula, port-and-starboard attachments. ♪ [cuts back to the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Help!
Mr. Krabs: Man overboard! Climb, Mr. Squidward! Climb! [They climb the mast, while the anchovies try to get them down. The anchovies then form a big wave.]
Anchovies: Meep! Meep!
Mr. Krabs: This is the end! Goodbye, Mr. Squidward!
Squidward: Oh, Mr. Krabs! [They cry, then SpongeBob comes in with red lights flashing and flying with the spatula, singing a heroic tune]
SpongeBob: Permission to come aboard captain! Da da da da da da da! Da da da da da da da da da da! Did someone order a spatula?
Squidward and Mr. Krabs: [stuttering while shocked at the SpongeBob getting the hydrodynamic spatula]
SpongeBob: That's right! One hydrodynamic spatula with [two spatulas pop out on the sides of the previous one] port-and-starboard attachments! And lets not forget the turbo drive! [the two extending spatulas twirl around and smack Squidward and Mr. Krabs in the face] Would you believe they only had one in stock? To the kitchen! [to the anchovies] Who's hungry?! [Tiny Tim's "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" plays while SpongeBob serves up Krabby Patty after Krabby Patty. Numerous Krabby Patties are launched through the opening window to the hungry anchovies. Eventually, all of the anchovies are served and they leave on the buses. Cuts to later.]
Mr. Krabs: That was the finest fast-foodsmanship I've ever seen, Mr. SquarePants. Welcome aboard. [Mr. Krabs gives SpongeBob a name tag]
Squidward: B-but, but, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for SpongeBob! Hip-hip!
Squidward: [weakly] Hooray, Mr.-
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip.
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. M-
Mr. Krabs: Hip-hip.
Squidward: [quickly] Hooray. Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: I'll be in my quarters, counting up the booty. [He wheels a wheelbarrow piled with an enormous stack of cash to his office. Patrick enters]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew!
Squidward: What would you like to order, Patrick?
Patrick: One Krabby Patty, please. [The instrumental to "Living in the Sunlight, Loving in the Moonlight" starts playing. SpongeBob flies back to the kitchen, using his spatula, and a score of Krabby Patties is immediately fired through the servery, which collide with Patrick and send him flying out of the Krusty Krab. Cuts to Krusty Krab exterior; crashing noises.]
Patrick: [screams]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs! Mr. Krabs! [calmly and singing] Mr. Krabs, come see your new employee.  
[Episode opens up with SpongeBob's, Patrick's, and Squidward's houses.]
[Squidward opens his door, sees that a flower does not stand up straight and then fixes it.]
[The scene pans to show that everything on his lawn is clean, except for a seashell on the left side of it.]
[The camera shows Squidward angry. He walks over to the seashell, looks around and kicks it onto SpongeBob's lawn while whistling casually.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's house. The window opens, and SpongeBob's face is shown. He exits through his window and sits on its rim. He notices the seashell on his lawn, he gets an idea and starts sliding to the back of his house to his garage to get a reef blower. The giant backpack-like container, with a blower hose, which looks like a jet engine, a power switch, and a pull starter.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward resting on his hammock.]
[Squidward hears the reef blower's motor throbbing. He sees SpongeBob exiting out of his garage with the reef blower. Squidward grumbles and puts in his ear plugs so that he can continue to rest.]
[SpongeBob gets to the seashell and tries to blow it away from his lawn by using the reef blower. He does this twice. He then blows extra hard, and a huge amount of sand is thrown in the air.]
[The scene changes to show Squidward eating some vegetables when the huge amount of sand falls from the sky and buries him. SpongeBob runs towards Squidward and blows the sand away.]
[Squidward looks at a leaf on his plate with grains of sand on it.]
[SpongeBob cleans the leaf in front of Squidward's head, tearing apart half of the leaf and causing grains of sand to get into Squidward's eyes. SpongeBob cleans Squidward's eyes with another blow.]
[The scene changes to show a large pile of sand on SpongeBob's lawn.]
[SpongeBob points his finger to it and mouths a word and the caption says "You!". He walks to the pile of sand, sets the reef blower to reverse and uses it suck up the sand from his lawn.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob's lawn clean, but then reef blower starts breaking apart, throwing out sand and parts of the machinery.]
[SpongeBob takes off the reef blower. He unzips the pack. He goes over to pick up the thrown out contents. The reef blower coughs while he is absent. He returns with large hands carrying the thrown out contents. He zips it back up and pulls the pull starter in an attempt to try to start it. The motor starts and then dies.]
[The camera shows him becoming angry or just determined. The scene changes, and he pulls the handle very far.]
[SpongeBob lets go of the handle, which stays still. SpongeBob wipes his hands together. He grabs the handle again. The handle pulls him away, leaving a bubble silhouette of SpongeBob that quickly dissolves. SpongeBob passes an intersection where two fish in two different cars going opposite directions stop. He passes some houses and finally returns to the reef blower, where he gets strapped in.]
[The reef blower starts, sucking up all the water in the sea, causing Squidward, who is sitting on his front doorstep, to gasp due to the inability to breathe air. His eyes also change into X's]
[The scene changes to show the reef blower massive, and then it explodes, causing water to cover the screen. When the water stops, the screen shows big piles of sand everywhere, but SpongeBob's lawn is relatively clean.]
[SpongeBob exits one of the piles, wipes his hands together, and happily enters his house.]
[Episode ends with Squidward at his doorstep, with a pile of sand covering him except for his head. The seashell falls on Squidward's nose. Squidward narrows his eyelids] 
SpongeBob: [Stands in Jellyfish Fields. A blue jellyfish floats by SpongeBob. SpongeBob comes from behind a bush and stares at the jellyfish through a telescope. Cuts to his view with the telescope] Wow, four stingers. [Puts away the telescope and puts on his glasses. Cuts to the jellyfish, where SpongeBob floats over it with his net. Cuts to the jellyfish alone, where SpongeBob's foot stretches out from off-screen and then the rest of his body appears. He attempts to grab the jellyfish in his net, but he catches himself in the net, then the jellyfish flies away. In the background, a young girl's voice is heard struggling. SpongeBob looks down a cliff and sees the land creature trying to fight a giant clam attempting. SpongeBob gasps] Where have I seen this before? [takes out his Field Guide book and skims through the pages] Here it is. [cut to picture of a squirrel] Land squirrel. [He closes the book] That little squirrel is in trouble. [cuts to the squirrel, who is pushing the clam into the ground]
Sandy: Take that, you sorry old clam! Y'all need to learn some manners! [she walks away] You're about as ugly as homemade soup.
SpongeBob: Hooray, land squirrel! [cuts back to the land squirrel, who is oblivious to the clam resurfacing and jumping right at her. Cuts to SpongeBob, who is shocked, his glasses shoot up] Look out! [scene cuts to the clam with Sandy trying to escape the clam] Hold on, little squirrel! [He does a karate yell in front of the clam, then does the same while bouncing to different sides. He jumps high in the air, and lands on top of the clam; he poses on top of the giant clam] You have fought well, giant clam. Prepare to be vanquished! Hai! [tries to pry open the clam; he stops] Hey, I'm actually doing it. [SpongeBob continues, Sandy finishes prying the clam open from inside it and SpongeBob goes flying into a sea plant] Your shell is mine!
[SpongeBob pulls up his pants and starts to charge at the clam. He jumps into the clam's mouth and starts to strangle its tongue. SpongeBob sees that Sandy has already escaped and the clam swallows him now.]
Sandy: Hold on there, little square dude! [She then gets SpongeBob out and kicks the clam around some more and finally kicks it across the sea. The clam whimpers. Sandy leans down to see if SpongeBob is okay.]
SpongeBob: Hey, you like karate too. [SpongeBob does some karate poses, then he stops and falls flat on his head] So, uhh, what's your name?
Sandy: Sandy. [makes athletic moves] So what do y'all call yourself?
SpongeBob: [runs up a big rock] I'm SpongeBob! [jumps down, SpongeBob soon lands on one of his corners]
Sandy: Well SpongeBob, take a gander at this. [she walks next to a huge rock and slaps it with her hand, making a gong sound effect which precedes the rock breaking into pieces]
SpongeBob: Oh. [Sandy grins and blinks] Oh yeah? Watch this [He prepares to do a karate move, but all he does is make an armpit fart noise. Sandy walks on-screen giggling]
Sandy: I like you, SpongeBob. Why, we could be tighter than bark on a tree. Hi-yah![Karate chops SpongeBob’s head.]
SpongeBob: Uh, I like you too, Sandy. Hi-yah! [Karate chops her helmet, but realizes it hurts.] Ow. Say, what is that thing on your head?
Sandy: Why, that's my air helmet.
SpongeBob: May I try it on?
Sandy: Heck no. I need it to breathe. I gotta have my air.
SpongeBob: Me too. I love air. Air is good.
Sandy: No kidding?
SpongeBob: Why, "air" is my middle name. The more air, the better. Can't get enough of that air.
Sandy: Shee-oot. How about comin' over tomorrow for tea and cookies then? [shows a map leading to Sandy's house] Don't be late.
SpongeBob: Okay, see you tomorrow. [runs to Patrick's house. Patrick is sun tanning on his rock] Patrick! Patrick! Patrick, Patrick, Patrick! What's air?
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: I just met this girl. She wears a hat full of... air.
Patrick: Do you mean she puts on "airs"?
SpongeBob: I guess so.
Patrick: That's just fancy talk. If you wanna be fancy, hold your pinky up like this. The higher you hold it, the fancier you are.
SpongeBob: [holds his pinky up] How's that?
Patrick: Higher.
SpongeBob: Like that?
Patrick: Now that's fancy. They should call you SpongeBob FancyPants. [cuts to Sandy's treedome] Remember: When in doubt, pinky out. You can do it, SpongeBob. I'll be watching. [Opens the door as SpongeBob walks in with his pinky raised high and flowers in his right hand.]
SpongeBob: Thanks, pal. [rings the doorbell with a bouquet in his hand]
Sandy: Hello?
SpongeBob: Hi-ya, Sandy. It’s me, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hold on a sec, I'll let you in.
SpongeBob: [whistles then all the water goes down the drain. SpongeBob bangs on the door] Sandy! Sandy! Open up! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob jiggles on the ground] Sandy, something's gone terribly wrong. There's no water in... [looks around] ...here.
Sandy: ‘Course there's no water. Nuttin' but air.
SpongeBob: [waves his hand around and smells the air] No water?
Sandy: That ain't a problem, is it? Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Problem? [laughing] Hi-yah! That's how I like my air! [takes a deep breath as Sandy walks off. As soon as she leaves, he lets it all out, and gets black circles around his eyes] With no water.
Sandy: [cartwheeling] Well, alright. I made Texas tea and cookies. Well, come on in! Hi-yah! [SpongeBob is walking an inch forward and it makes weak squeaking sounds with every step] That's not in. In. [SpongeBob walks another inch and there is more squeaking. Sandy runs, gets SpongeBob, takes his hand, and runs off] You're a funny little dude. Come on, I'll give you the grand tour. [fades to the blazing sun and pan down where Sandy and SpongeBob are standing] So this is my own private little air bubble. This air is the driest... [SpongeBob gasps] ...purest... [SpongeBob gasps again] ...most airiest air in the whole sea. Oh, over there's my birdbath. [Cuts to the birdbath, where a red robin is splashing and chirping] And that's my oak tree. [SpongeBob seems enticed by the water in the birdbath. He tries to sneak away, but stays until Sandy lets her guard down] It provides me with extra air. This dome is made of the finest polyurethane, that's a fancy word for plastic. Ain't that just the bees knees? [SpongeBob nods] Tell you what, weren't easy getting here neither. First, I... [SpongeBob finally escapes and wallows in the birdbath, absorbing all the water. He then jumps back to his original spot, and the bird is quite angry. SpongeBob gets back before Sandy notices] ...that's my treadmill. That's how I stay in tip-top shape. Well, come on. Let’s have that tea now. [Does in-air karate moves and moves off-screen. SpongeBob gasps. He hears some knocking from outside. It's Patrick, pointing at his pinky]
Patrick: Pinky. Pinky.
SpongeBob: [blinks, weakly holds up his pinky, and gasps again. Fade to him sitting at a picnic bench. He now has little wrinkles around his eyes and his mouth is all puckered up. He holds up his bouquet] I brought you some flowers.
Sandy: [walks over] For me? How sweet. [Sandy grabs the flowers, but SpongeBob refuses to let go. She finally pries them loose and part of SpongeBob's pinky falls off. He closes his hand] You okay?
SpongeBob: [the black circles around his eyes are gone. His voice is now hoarse] Yes, I'm okay.
Sandy: You know, you're the first sea critter to ever visit.
SpongeBob: I can’t imagine why.
Sandy: Can I get you anything?
SpongeBob: Water would be nice.
Sandy: I'm gonna to put these in a vase.
SpongeBob: Take your time. [Sandy goes in her tree and closes the door off-screen. SpongeBob hears it, he then gasps and stumbles toward the door and struggles to open it] I gotta get out of here! Aaaahh! [he then thinks]
Sandy: [in SpongeBob's head] I like you, SpongeBob. We could be tighter than bark on a tree.
[SpongeBob struggles even more]
Patrick: [in SpongeBob's head] When in doubt, pinky out.
SpongeBob: [lifts his pinky up. He then gets confidence and victorious music plays.] I don't need water! Water's for quitters! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it! I don't need it, I don't need it... [he then sits down, loses confidence again and the music stops]
Sandy: Why, these flowers are just beautiful! [sniffs] They'll last much, much longer in a vase full of ice cold water. [puts the vase down. SpongeBob is totally enticed by the water. Sandy sits down across from him] So tell me about yourself. [Sandy puts her hands under head feeling fascinated about SpongeBob sharing himself] It must be fascinatin' bein' a sea critter. [SpongeBob watches a drop of water drop down the side of the glass] SpongeBob? [a timer goes off] Oh, there's the cookies. [walks back into the tree] Be right back.
SpongeBob: [thinking] I don't need it, I don't need it, I definitely don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face. He's really shriveled now] I don't need it. [close-up of vase, then another one of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [close-up of vase] I don't need it. [close-up of SpongeBob's face] I don't need it. [long pause, finally yelling ] I need it! [He shoots up into the air, bounces off the ceiling and holds the vase.]
Patrick: No, SpongeBob! No, no, no, stop! Pinky! Pinky!
SpongeBob: [holds up his pinky and starts guzzling down the whole vase of water] I'm a quitter! [screams and runs around]
Patrick: [enters into the dome and slams the door shut] You can't leave now. You'll blow it.
SpongeBob: [hanging on the door] Air is not good, Patrick. Air is not good.
Patrick: [grabs SpongeBob off the door] You're just being shy. [carries SpongeBob to the picnic table] Don't worry, buddy. You're doi'’ fine. [starts getting weak] I won't let you blow... this. [drops SpongeBob and crawls on the floor, panting. He coughs and sputters, then stands up] What kind of place is this?! [runs toward the door and tries to open it] There's no water in here!
SpongeBob: [joins in on the door-opening struggle] I tried to tell you!
Patrick: We've gotta get out of here!
SpongeBob: You're... doing it... wrong...
Patrick: Wait, no! We've got... to get... out. [The two pass out.]
[fades to the sun]
Sandy: [walks out of the tree with tea and cookies] Come and get it! Y'all gonna like this...
[She screams and drops her tray. On the grass is a live-action sponge and starfish. Cuts to SpongeBob and Patrick leaning against a ladder with two goldfish helmets on. Sandy, on top of the ladder, uses a hose to fill those helmets with water]
Sandy: There, that oughta do it! If y'all needed water, you shoulda asked. [Sandy carries over a tray with three tea glasses. Everyone takes one] I propose a toast, to new friends. [She drinks it. SpongeBob and Patrick lift their drinks up and they clink the glasses on the helmets, causing them to spill] Hold on a second. [She places a tea bag in each helmet, allowing the two to drink the tea water] I hope you like your tea strong. Drink up. [Patrick nudges SpongeBob and they both put their pinkies up. They sip the tea.]
All: Ahhh...
[Screen cuts to black.]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks outside his house, and breathes in the fresh air] Ahh, what a wonderful day. The sun is out, the water is shimmering, scallops are chirping. So peaceful. [SpongeBob immediately grabs wood, a hammer, and some nails, and starts to noisily build a stand. Squidward peeks his head out the window]
Squidward: Can we lower the volume, please? I can't work with all that racket going on!
SpongeBob: Oh, sure thing, Squidward.
Squidward: Yes. Mmm. Right. Mmm.
SpongeBob: Okay. [he taps on a nail lightly, and he looks up at Squidward's window. He does it again, and continues to, making sure he doesn't make too much noise. Meanwhile, in Squidward's house, Squidward has his clarinet in hand]
Squidward: And now... for some soothing sounds from Squidward's clarinet. Thank you, thank you. [He starts to play. SpongeBob looks up and sees that Squidward is playing, so he decides to finish his stand quickly. Squidward looks out the window again.]
Squidward: I thought I... Wha?
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Wanna blow some bubbles? Only 25 cents.
Squidward: Oh, right. Like I would spend a moment of my time blowing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Uh huh.
Squidward: Oh, puh-lease. I mean, who in the world would pay to blow bubbles? [Patrick comes out of his house, stuck to the underside of the rock]
Patrick: Good morning. [he falls and screams]
Squidward: Oh, boy. [Patrick walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Good morning to you, sir. Would you care to blow a bubble?
Patrick: Hmm, how much is it?
SpongeBob: Only a quarter.
Patrick: Sounds reasonable. [whispering] Uh, I'm going to need to borrow a quarter.
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Patrick. [he pulls out a quarter and he gives it to Patrick]
Patrick: Ah, one quarter. [he hands the quarter back to SpongeBob, and bites it to see if it's real]
SpongeBob: Thank you. [cuts back to Squidward]
Squidward: Hmm, business is booming. [he laughs] How did I ever get surrounded by such loser neighbors? Uh huh. [he continues playing. Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob dips the wand in the bubble soap]
SpongeBob: One bubble wand, dipped and ready to go. [Patrick grabs the wand from SpongeBob, inhales deeply and begins to blow, but a bubble doesn't come out. He pants and blows again. After a while, SpongeBob puts up a "Lessons" sign. Patrick then loses his breath] Could I interest you in some lessons? Only 25 cents.
Patrick: Uh, very well, then. Hey, Sponge, can I borrow another quarter? [SpongeBob hands Patrick a quarter] Thanks. [he winks and hands the quarter back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, it's all in the technique. [he starts doing his infamous routine] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [he blows bubbles shaped like ducks]
Patrick: Oooh. [SpongeBob pops out of nowhere and blows a box. Patrick giggles and SpongeBob blows a caterpillar] Ah! [The caterpillar then pops one-by-one, with descending sounds. Patrick continues to giggle. SpongeBob blows a boat, and it floats off, pops, and makes a foghorn noise. Cuts to inside of Squidward's house]
Squidward: Huh? [he shakes his clarinet. Cut back to outside with SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: And now... with two hands! [he inhales deeply and blows out an elephant. Circus music, in particular part of the piece "Entry of the Gladiators", starts playing.]
Patrick: [Laughs] It's a giraffe! [Patrick continues laughing as the elephant floats over into Squidward's house. SpongeBob then frowns as the bubble pops and tons of smaller bubbles come out of both windows of the house while an elephant sounds. Squidward opens the door with a sour look on his face. SpongeBob and Patrick hide behind the stand. SpongeBob places a "Closed" sign on it. Squidward looks over the stand]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, sir, but we are clo-
Squidward: Don't give me any of that! How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?!
SpongeBob: We're not just blowing bubbles. We're making bubble art. Watch carefully. [he does his infamous routine again] First go like this, spin around. Stop! Double take three times: one, two, three. Then pelvic thrust! Whoooo! Whooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it! Now it's time to bring it around town. Bring-it-a-round-town. Then you do this, then this, and this, and that, and-this-and-that-and-this-and-that, and then... [he blows a butterfly, which flies over to Squidward, lands on his head, and pops]
Squidward: That's not art. That's just annoying. Blowing bubbles, that's the lamest idea I have ever heard. [SpongeBob and Patrick, now depressed, head to SpongeBob's house] You should be ashamed of yourselves. [SpongeBob closes the door as Squidward laughs to himself] Bubbles. [he continues laughing] Art. [he mumbles, and picks up the bubble wand, sniffs it, and inhales to blow. Then, SpongeBob pops up out of nowhere]
SpongeBob: That'll be 25 cents, sir.
Squidward: Ah, whoa, what? [SpongeBob blinks] Oh... who-who would pay 25 cents to blow bubbles?
SpongeBob: We also offer lessons for beginners. [he puts the "Lessons" sign up]
Squidward: Beginners? What could be more simple than blowing a stupid bubble? [he pulls a quarter out] Here's your 25 cents! [SpongeBob bites it to see if it's real and it bends] Watch and learn. [he inhales and blows, but nothing happens] Uhh... wait, wait, wait. [he inhales and blows again, but nothing happens again] One more time. Here. Wait. [he inhales and blows again, and a small bubble comes out and instantly falls to the ground and bursts, making a raspberry sound. Looks over at SpongeBob and Patrick. They gulp, and then start whistling. Squidward places another quarter on the stand] Uhh... Just a mere warm-up. [he dips the wand in the bubble container, inhales deeply and blows hard. The bubble falls to the ground again, making another raspberry sound, gets another quarter out and puts it on the stand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, remember the technique. [Squidward keeps trying to blow bubbles while SpongeBob and Patrick are trying to show him the technique] Squidward, technique! You do this, and this, step back....
Patrick: Hey! Technique, Squidward!
SpongeBob: Spin around like thi— Like this... Look at me, over here, one... two.... yeah, three...
Patrick: The pelvic woo!
SpongeBob: Look, we're doing the technique! And don't for... Don't forget the "Woooooo!" Squidward?
Patrick: Listen to Sponge!
SpongeBob: Technique! Technique! Technique!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [while standing on one foot] Technique! Technique! Technique! Technique! Tech- [Squidward looks at them]
SpongeBob: [weakly] You're not doing the technique.
Patrick: Technique.
Squidward: Technique? Technique!? Technique, technique, technique, technique, technique! [he starts to do the infamous routine, while imitating SpongeBob] First I do this, spin around. Stop. Double take three times. And here we go, pelvic thrust. Wehooooo! Wehoohoo! Oh, stop on your right foot, don't forget it. Then, bring it around town. And a little of this, a little of that, a little of this, this, this, this, that, that, that, that. And that, that, that that that that! And then... [Screams into the wand, blowing a gargantuan, unshaped bubble]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [Squidward is then lifted off the ground. The bubble pops off the wand and Squidward falls back on the ground]
SpongeBob: All right, Squid. That was so good.
Patrick: Squid is number one.
Squidward: I really did it, didn't I? Hey, you guys didn't blow anything like that.
SpongeBob: No.
Squidward: Now that's a bubble.
SpongeBob: You said it, Squidward. See, it is all in the technique.
Patrick: Yeah, technique.
Squidward: Technique? Hah. SpongeBob, you don't think I created that [kisses his tentacle] beautiful work of art with your help? [he starts laughing] Come on, it's in my genes.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squid's got genes! Squid's got genes! [Squidward walks back to his house]
Squidward: Thank you, thank you, thank you. [he starts to play his clarinet. SpongeBob and Patrick chant Squidward's name. At one point, they belly flop each other and Patrick falls on the ground.] I rock. [Squidward continues to play his clarinet. As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to chant, Squidward's bubble flies over them, covers Squidward's house, and pulls it out of the ground and up towards the top of the ocean. SpongeBob notices and stops Patrick]
SpongeBob: [concerned] Squidward! [Patrick now notices]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward! Squidward! [Squidward stops playing his clarinet]
Squidward: Hello, my friends. You are looking at a... [he sees how far he is from the surface]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
Squidward: ...genius. [the bubble explodes in the air and then the ground violently rumbles and shakes. SpongeBob and Patrick look in awe]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [the ground stops shaking. The two slowly walk back to their homes. They then speed up and run inside their houses. Squidward's house floats back to the surface. He starts playing his clarinet weakly as the screen fades to black, ending the episode]
[Pan across Goo Lagoon]
Narrator: Ah, Goo Lagoon. A stinky mud puddle to you and me. But to the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom, a wonderful, stinky mud puddle. [SpongeBob and Sandy sit enjoying the beach. SpongeBob sighs]
SpongeBob: What a great day. [he runs off] Hey, Sandy! Look! [he is now covered in a mound of sand] I'm Sandy! [Sandy laughs. SpongeBob forms sand around his head and nose to look like Squidward and imitates his voice] Hey Sandy, who am I? [Sandy still laughs. SpongeBob picks up a sand phone] Hello, SpongeBob. Could you keep it down? I'm trying to be boring. [Sandy continues laughing]
Sandy: SpongeBob! [a doorbell rings, SpongeBob walks in carrying sand pizza boxes and wearing a Krusty Krab sand hat]
SpongeBob: Did anyone order twenty pepperoni and sand pizzas? [SpongeBob and Sandy laugh together. Larry walks up]
Larry: Hey, Sandy. Hey, SpongeBob.
Sandy: Hey, Larry.
Larry: You guys wanna go lift some weights?
Sandy: Sure. [she and Larry walk off] Well come on, SpongeBob. [SpongeBob's sand pizzas and hat fall flat as he walks on dejectedly]
SpongeBob: [disappointingly] Coming. [Cut to a group of weightlifters, each grunting as they work out. Larry turns to Sandy]
Larry: Give it a try, Sandy. [Sandy stands in front of a weight. She picks it up, grunting as she does so. The crowd cheers for her, and she throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: Good job, Sandy. Well, that's about enough for today, don't you think? [SpongeBob tries to walk off]
Larry: How about a little more weight? [Larry bends down to pick up a weight heavier than Sandy's] Observe. [Larry grunts as he picks it up, his eyes bulging, and veins stick out from his neck. The crowd cheers, and Larry throws the weight down]
SpongeBob: All right, stand back, everyone. [SpongeBob picks up a single twig from the ground. The crowd is silent. He sinks into the sand. Sandy walks to a weight]
Sandy: Y'all watch this! [Sandy picks up an anchor weight. The crowd cheers for her, but stop when they realize Larry has lifted the spectator stands] Way to go, Larry! [SpongeBob burrows into the sand, and tunnels over to a fish picnicking next to a marshmallow sack]
SpongeBob: Could I borrow a couple of these?
Fish: [through his marshmallow-filled mouth] Mm-hmm. [crams another marshmallow into his mouth. SpongeBob takes two marshmallows and places them on the twig] And now, with the addition of two, count 'em, two marshmallows. [SpongeBob preps himself for his lift, inhales deeply, takes hold of the twig, and is unable to lift it. The crowd isn't moved. He tries again. And again. After a huge effort, SpongeBob hears a rip. He looks down and notices that he's ripped his pants. The crowd gasps, then laughs at SpongeBob. SpongeBob scuttles off, embarrassed. Scooter walks over, laughing]
Scooter: That was too funny. [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] You are hilarious!
Sandy: Ain't he the funniest little Sponge you ever saw? [SpongeBob grins widely. Cut to Larry]
Larry: Anybody up for some volleyball? [the ball volleys back and forth, until Larry spikes it into some fish and the crowd cheers for him. SpongeBob looks at him in contempt. A fish serves the ball and as Larry is about to hit it, SpongeBob interferes]
SpongeBob: I got it! [the ball falls and SpongeBob tries to serve it] Incoming! [the serve misses and the crowd boos. He bends down to pick the ball up and rips his pants] Oops, I guess I ripped my pants again! [the crowd laughs. Scooter walks in laughing again]
Scooter: Once again, dude, [he slaps SpongeBob on the back] YOU have split my sides! [he continues to laugh. Cut to a Frisbee. Larry catches it and throws it to Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, how about throwing it to me?
Sandy: Okay, here it comes! [SpongeBob stands still and lets the Frisbee hit him on the head, knocking him over]
SpongeBob: I could use a hand here! [he laughs. Sandy walks over and helps him up]
Sandy: You okay, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I guess so... [he does a handstand, revealing his pants] ...except I ripped my pants! [the crowd laughs, and Scooter walks up to SpongeBob once again]
Scooter: You still got it, dude! [he slaps SpongeBob on the back again. Cut to SpongeBob and Sandy walking to an ice cream vendor]
Lou Vendor: May I help you?
SpongeBob: I'll take a banana split.
Lou: Uh, we don't have that.
SpongeBob: That's okay. I already split my pants! Get it? [Sandy giggles]
Lou: [annoyed] Tee-hee. Anything else?
SpongeBob: How about ripple? [he does so, Sandy giggles again] No, thanks, already got one! [Sandy drops laughing, Lou is unamused, and SpongeBob happily bounces off to a snack bar. SpongeBob runs up to Harold, knocking his drink over] Is that a burger you're eating?
Harold: Why, yes, it is.
SpongeBob: You know what would go good with that?
Harold: No, what?
SpongeBob: [whispers] Ripped... pants. [SpongeBob smiles widely and shows the annoyed Harold his ripped pants. SpongeBob then runs around the snack bar, laughing. He comes up in-between two fish] Ripped pants a la mode! [he rips his pants, the fish are annoyed. Cut to SpongeBob being in the kitchen of the snack bar, next to the fry cook] Delivery! Did you order twenty cases of ripped pants? [SpongeBob shoves his behind through the box, revealing his ripped pants. He laughs and the box is revealed to have no lower part. The fry cook groans disgustedly. Cut to a broadcasting booth over looking the lagoon]
Perch Perkins: Surf's up in the Goo Lagoon. [fish are surfing. Close-up of Perch Perkins] And here comes Larry, doing his trademark lay-back. [cut to Larry lying on his surfboard] There goes Sandy, hanging ten... fingers, that is. [cut to Sandy doing a handstand on her surfboard] There goes SpongeBob... [rip] ripping his pants again. [Perch Perkins is annoyed, then cut to SpongeBob ripping his pants on his surfboard. A wave knocks SpongeBob off his surfboard and washes him up on the beach]
Lifeguard: Hey, look! A cardboard box washed up on the beach. [he takes a closer look through his telescope] Holy fish paste! It's a guy! [he sprints over to SpongeBob and flips him over] Why?! Why?! Why?! [a crowd gathers around SpongeBob and the lifeguard]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [to lifeguard] Come closer. [a divine light shines on him] I need... I need...
Lifeguard: What do you need? [tears come to the lifeguard's and Sandy's eyes]
SpongeBob: [pats the lifeguard on the shoulder. Close up of SpongeBob's mouth] A tailor. [the light turns off, accompanied by a light switch] Because I ripped my pants! [he laughs. The lifeguard makes an annoyed expression, drops SpongeBob, and the crowd surrounding him walks off, angrily. SpongeBob is left alone and Sandy walks up to him angry]
Sandy: That wasn't funny, SpongeBob! Y'all had me worried sick! [she walks off. Scooter walks towards SpongeBob and looks at him sadly]
Scooter: [he shakes his head] Dude... [he walks off. Cut to a dressing tent, with SpongeBob inside]
SpongeBob: [thinking] Come on, SpongeBob, you're losing them! Think! Your public's waiting. [speaking] Let's see... [checking them off a list] "Lifting weights - big laugh," "Frisbee in face - kills," "Surfing - knocks 'em dead," "Pretending to drown," [he uses his pencil to write the word "NO" and circle it] No. Come on, think! I got it! Hey, everybody! [he runs out of the dressing tent] Not ripped pants! [he tears his pants off] Pants ripped off. Huh? Someone call the police. There's a pants thief on the loose! [the wind howls, SpongeBob standing alone on the beach. A tumbleweed rolls by. SpongeBob turns and hears party music at a distance, and sees Larry and Sandy playing volleyball] Oh, no, everybody's gone, even Sandy. She'd rather hang out with Larry! Oh, no. [lies on the beach as he continues saying, no] We blew it, pants. [throws his pants aside]
Pants: What do you mean, "we?" [the pants walk off, leaving SpongeBob alone]
SpongeBob: Oh, I didn't have to be a fool to get Sandy's attention. Am I the biggest loser on the beach?! [Millie walks up to SpongeBob, shining red]
Jennifer: No, I am. I forgot to put on sunscreen. [she places a fin on herself, and it leaves a sounding mark, which vanishes]
SpongeBob: Ouch. [a fish walks up to the two]
Dexter: No, I am. I got sand in my buns. [he shows them two sandy hamburger buns. There is a rumbling coming from the sand and a whale pops his head out of the sand]
Frank: No, I'm the biggest loser on the beach. They buried me in the sand and forgot me.
All: What happened to you?
SpongeBob: I lost my best friend.
All: How? [SpongeBob grabs a sand guitar and sings]
SpongeBob: When I ripped... [his underwear starts ripping] my pants. [he starts to sing] I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky-high, and now she won't even spare a passing glance, all just because I [rips his underwear again] ripped my pants. [the other three "losers of the beach" assemble on a sand stage with sand instruments and sing]
All: ♪When big Larry came round just to put him down, SpongeBob turned into a clown, and no girl ever wants to dance with a fool who went and [Jennifer turns around and suddenly, her bottom then rips, splitting open, revealing her white underwear] ripped his pants!♪
SpongeBob: [singing voice, a crowd begins to gather] ♪I know I shouldn't mope around, I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. 'Cause winding up with no one is a lot less fun than a burn from the sun...♪
All: ♪Or sand in your buns!♪ [instrumental break. The sandy bun fish scrapes the two buns together to make a rhythm then the curtain shows waves crashing about]
SpongeBob: ♪Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget... so listen and you won't regret. Be true to yourself; don't miss your chance... and you won't end up like the fool... who... ripped... his... pants!♪ [the whole group comes together one by one in sync with the music and they rip their pants. By now, a huge crowd has gathered and is cheering the group onstage. A blimp flies by with SpongeBob's name on it. It's revealed that SpongeBob and his band were having a concert.]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Sandy! [she gets onstage and hugs SpongeBob. He returns the embrace]
Sandy: Your song is true. If y'all want to be my friend, just be yourself. [Larry walks up]
Larry: [impressed with SpongeBob's singing during the big concert] SpongeBob, that was so righteous. [hands SpongeBob a pencil] Would you... sign my pants?
SpongeBob: Absolutely, buddy. [SpongeBob bends down to sign Larry's pants. His underwear then rips off completely, leaving SpongeBob "au naturel." Someone off-screen whistles. SpongeBob covers his crotch, grins, and blushes sheepishly]
[Opens in on a bunch of jellyfish and one flying out of the field towards SpongeBob's block]
Narrator: Ah, ze early morning in Bikini Bottom, when the jellyfish are buzzing about and making their jellyfish jelly. [A jellyfish flies by SpongeBob's house. Just then a giant periscope comes out of the porthole] Oh, what is happening here? [SpongeBob is looking through the periscope from inside, Patrick waits behind him] Collectors? [SpongeBob nods to Patrick. They both run toward two vents: one square shaped, one circular shaped. SpongeBob takes the square one and Patrick takes the circle one. The two approach ropes and slide down them. At the bottom, they encounter a case of rope burn and jump around frantically. They blow their hands to remove the burn. Once the burn is gone, the two get serious again and approach a closet. It houses three sets of poles and three sets of nets. SpongeBob and Patrick take one of each, connect them and test their mobility. SpongeBob puts on his glasses and the two seriously step out ready for action. A jellyfish flies by and the two joyfully sing and follow it]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] I think I've got it! Wait a minute... [we hear jellyfish stings and SpongeBob and Patrick screaming. The two run back the way they came, being chased by the jellyfish. They fall into a heap in front of Squidward's house. The jellyfish stings both of their backsides and flies off. Just then, Squidward comes out of his house with his bike]
Squidward: Hm.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, we're jellyfishing.
Squidward: Of course you are. Bye now. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Wait! We made a net especially for you! [holds it up] Do you want to come with us?
Squidward: [sarcastically] Really? Jellyfishing with you guys? Oh, that would be the best day ever in my book! I would love to go jellyfishing! I can't think of anything I'd like to do more on my day off than go jellyfishing with my two best friends: SpongeBob and... uh...
Patrick: Patrick.
Squidward: Right. But I can't. Bye bye.
SpongeBob: Next time?
Squidward: Oh sure, right! Whatever. [bikes away; under breath] Like that'll ever happen.
SpongeBob: You know, Patrick? It always seems like Squidward never has time for fun.
Patrick: Maybe he doesn't like us.
SpongeBob: No, are you kidding? We're his best friends. [Squidward bikes down a path, chuckling to himself]
Squidward: Jellyfishing. [as he laughs, his nose inflates and deflates] Oh, I'll go. [laughs] I sure had them going. [laughs. But, he doesn't see a jellyfish which is going in the opposite direction. He keeps on laughing. The jellyfish ends up swimming in Squidward's mouth and he coughs it out] Stupid jellyfish! Beat it! [He hits it, and the jellyfish goes up his shirt and starts zapping him, causing Squidward to veer out of control. His tentacles get tangled on the pedals and he trips on a rock. He bounces down a hill and then falls down a jagged rocky cliff. He reaches the bottom of the cliff and immediately an atomic explosion appears.] Ow...
[Cut to SpongeBob sitting at his house. He looks out the window. But, no one is there. He sits down again. He notices a photo of him and an unhappy Squidward that reads, "Friends." He puts it down and looks out the window again. Squidward, who's in a wheelchair and all bandaged up rolls down the path]
SpongeBob: Squid's back! [he phones Patrick, which causes the screen to split diagonally, revealing Patrick on the bottom]
Patrick: Yello?
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, Squid's home! And we're gonna make sure he's greeted by his two best friends!
Patrick: Oh, great! Who are they? [it's revealed that the two are phoning each other from across the room, just with different wallpapers]
SpongeBob: Us! [the two hang up] Let's go! [Squidward wheels himself into his house. The lights suddenly turn on, and party horns can be heard. SpongeBob and Patrick are inside his house with a banner that says "Welcome Home"] Welcome home, Squidward!
Patrick: Merry Christmas!
SpongeBob: We're gonna make this your best day ever! [Squidward turns around and wheels out. SpongeBob rolls him back in] Well, your best day's sure not gonna be out there. [SpongeBob wheels Squidward to a table where Patrick stands by a bowl of soup]
Patrick: How about some soup on your best day ever? [Squidward looks at the soup and sees Alphabet Soup letters spelling out, "Best Day Ever" Patrick holds up a spoon] Here we go! [he scoops some up, but Squidward makes some grunting noises in refusal] Oh, it's a little hot. [he blows on the spoon, sending steaming hot soup splashing all over Squidward's bandaged face. Patrick notices his spoon is empty and refills it to blow on, covering Squidward in more hot soup. This continues for three times until SpongeBob pulls the soup bowl away and laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: I don't think soup is the best thing for him on his best day ever. [walks near a music stand and Squidward's clarinet] How about some music on your best day ever? Played on your very own clarinet. [he blows into it, but wind comes out causing Squidward to groan] Sorry, my lips are a little dry. [He wets his lips exaggeratedly long and wet. Just when he prepares to blow, a disgusted Patrick snatches the clarinet away]
Patrick: Music isn't best either!
SpongeBob: But what is best is what we saved for last. The one sure-fire thing to make your best day ever the best day ever! [cut to SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward in Jellyfish Fields. SpongeBob and Patrick hold nets]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [chanting] Jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing, jellyfishing!
SpongeBob: This is Jellyfish Fields, where wild jellyfish roam just waiting to be captured. [Squidward rides away, but SpongeBob catches him] No, no, Squid! Over here! I know you're eager, but you don't even have your net. Patrick, fix him up while I find him a good specimen.
Patrick: Firmly grasp it in your hand. [he places the pole end on Squidward's bandaged hand, but it falls because he can't grab, Patrick picks it up] Firmly grasp it. [he does it again and the results are the same. Patrick gets frustrated] Firmly grasp it! [he forcefully jabs the net through Squidward's bandaged hand. Squidward lets out a muffled pained scream] That oughta do it. [SpongeBob spots a jellyfish]
SpongeBob: There's one in position. Ready... set... go! [the two yell out words of encouragement to Squidward and jump up and down, but Squidward isn't budging. The two eventually notice Squidward isn't going anywhere. They again encourage him, but still nothing happens]
Patrick: I think we gotta show him how it's done. [in the tune of "The Beautiful Blue Danube," SpongeBob and Patrick dance along next to the jellyfish and try to catch it. SpongeBob and Patrick sing, and even the jellyfish hums out some music. After several attempts, they get into a big fight with stinging and such. The jellyfish escapes the squabbles and swims by Squidward and stings him on the nose. Squidward, mad, goes after the jellyfish. SpongeBob and Patrick, still getting stung by jellyfish, notice]
SpongeBob: Hey, look! Squid's doing it! [as Squidward chases, SpongeBob and Patrick cheer him on. His wheelchair is stopped by a rock, but he eventually gets back on track. The jellyfish lands on a pink "rock" and Squidward catches it. He laughs triumphantly, but muffled due to the bandages and whacks the net against the "rock". The "rock" surfaces, revealing to be a really huge jellyfish, the Queen Jellyfish. She now floats above Squidward. Squidward gulps. SpongeBob and Patrick look on.]
Patrick: This guy's good.
SpongeBob: He's a natural!
[SpongeBob and Patrick start cheering Squidward on as he tries to get away from the Queen Jellyfish.]
SpongeBob: [Simultaneously cheering] Yeah, you're doing great! Go, Squid, go!
Patrick: [Simultaneously cheering] Yeah, you got it, Squidward! Yeah, you're doing it, Squid! See what you've been missing?
SpongeBob: [Simultaneously cheering] Yeah, you got, Squid!
Patrick: [Simultaneously cheering] You got what you wanted, Squidward! You can go that distance! Use that net!
SpongeBob: Be the net!
Patrick: Yeah! You're feeling it, Squid! That's it, all the way! The last 6 miles, make that, Squid! Go, go, go!
SpongeBob: [Simultaneously] Yeah, go by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger, by the eye of the tiger! Better, better, better! Yeah, yeah, yeah! You've got it now!
Patrick: It's in the bag!
SpongeBob: This is really your best day ever, isn't it?
[The Queen Jellyfish gives Squidward an extremely powerful sting. SpongeBob and Patrick stop cheering.]
Both: Oooh...
[Cut to the next day where SpongeBob and Patrick walking in front of Squidward's place covered in bandages]
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick. Well... [sighs] Thought yesterday went... [hesitates] pretty well, don't you think?
Patrick: I had fun.
SpongeBob: Me too. [some whirring is heard in the background]
Patrick: Here comes Squidward!
SpongeBob: Oh, great. [Squidward approaches in a stretcher] Hey, Squid! How about that... [Squidward rolls down the front walk in a wheeled medical bed with a container of life-saving fluid and in a full body cast.] ...best day ever?
Patrick: There's always tomorrow! [Squidward's bed bangs on the door, trying to get in]
SpongeBob: Um, we're really sorry about what happened yesterday, Squidward. [he bangs the door again] Um, we got you a present! [it's the jellyfish that caused Squidward to encounter the Queen Jellyfish in a jar] It's the jellyfish. [Squidward scowls]
Patrick: You know, from yesterday!
SpongeBob: You're not still mad, are you? [Squidward opens the jar in SpongeBob and Patrick's direction]
Patrick: Yup, he's still mad. [The jellyfish chases after SpongeBob and Patrick and stings them repeatedly as they run into the distance screaming. Squidward laughs to himself, his nose inflating and deflating again. The Queen Jellyfish returns and zaps him again. Now he's burnt to a crisp. The cast cracks off in pieces, leaving a completely blackened Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. 
[View of the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [from inside] One Krabby Patty for table two. SpongeBob, I don't have the whole day. [cut to inside of the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Oui, oui. Un Krabby Patty, Monsieur. First, les patty. [flips it up in the air and it falls into one of his holes. He holds up the other ingredients]
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Next, les ingredients. [throws them in the air] Ah, oui! [he catches them in his holes and his pants] Les mustard. [he squirts some mustard out and it lands in his eye]
Squidward: Les quit fooling around, where's my Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Les hold on a second! [SpongeBob takes his head and shakes it all up. When he puts it back on his body, his eyes roll around] And voila! [He goes up to Squidward and pulls a Krabby Patty from under his nose] It's under your nose! [Laughs and puts it on a plate. Squidward pretends to laugh]
Squidward: You're killing me, SpongeBob! Ha ha ha... you really are. [Close-up on the patty].
SpongeBob: Look at it, Squidward. Mr. Krabs' gift to all of Bikini Bottom -- the Krabby Patty..
Squidward: Okay, give it to me. [The Krabby Patty flies off of the plate and starts bouncing all over the place] Come on SpongeBob, stop it!
SpongeBob: I swear I'm not doing anything. Mr. Krabs! The Krabby Patty is haunted! [The patty slithers out the door and heads for the exit. Mr. Krabs spears it with his leg. A tiny thing comes out from it and Krabs inspects it with a magnifying glass.]
Mr. Krabs: Avast, ye patty pirate! This is no ghost. This is... [view of in the magnifying glass, of a tiny jelly bean-shaped green creature with one eye] Plankton! Stealing me booty!
Sheldon J. Plankton: Hear me, Krabs. When I discover your formula for Krabby Patties, I'll run you out of business. I went to college! [Krabs picks up the puny pest] Hey! Let me go!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, I'll let you go, squirt. On a flying saucer! [laughs. He splats Plankton on a plate and spins him back across the street, to the Chum Bucket] Back to the Chum Bucket with you!
Plankton: You'll pay for this, Krabs! [slams through the doors]
SpongeBob: Uh... Plankton, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, he's been trying to steal me secret formula for years, but you haven't got it yet, have ye, bug? [laughs. SpongeBob joins in, braying with laughter. Krabs stops, but SpongeBob keeps laughing] Okay. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Enough, lad, it wasn't that funny. [SpongeBob keeps laughing] Get back to work! [SpongeBob stops laughing. Cut to nighttime at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [from inside] Okay, Mr. Krabs, see you tomorrow!
Mr. Krabs: Good night, me boy! [SpongeBob walks out and walks past the Chum Bucket contently]
Plankton: [unseen] Psst... young man. [SpongeBob looks around to see where this voice came from] Yes, over here. Come on, boy, a little closer. [SpongeBob walks forward] Closer... [SpongeBob walks] Not that close! [a crunching sound is heard. SpongeBob lifts up his shoe revealing a squished Plankton] You blasted barnacle head! I mean... hi. [SpongeBob peels Plankton off his shoe and onto his hand]
SpongeBob: Plankton? What do you want?
Plankton: I just want to talk. You could say we're friends, right?
SpongeBob: Um... no.
Plankton: Acquaintances?
SpongeBob: No.
Plankton: Well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?
SpongeBob: I... guess so.
Plankton: You see? Everything works out. I have something for you. I've been keeping it in my secret compartment. [rummages through his back pocket and takes out a golden spatula] Ching! [in unison with the sparkling of the spatula] Sparkle, sparkle.
SpongeBob: Wow! A golden spatula! And it's even got my name on it.
Plankton: It's a gift! A gift from a friend. [hugs SpongeBob's thumb] Friends give each other gifts, and tomorrow is my birthday. [puts a birthday hat on his head and SpongeBob's thumb and then blows a noisemaker. He then takes out a cake] And you know what I'd like more than anything in the whole wide world? [blows out the candles].
SpongeBob: A booster seat? [Plankton takes off the hat and throws out the cake]
Plankton: Booster seat? Hot dog! I mean, no. What I want for my birthday from you, my friend, is one of those [starts to drool] tender... delicious... Krabby Patties! [SpongeBob drops Plankton and gasps]
SpongeBob: You just want to be friends so you can get your hands on a Krabby Patty! And I bet it's not even your birthday tomorrow.
Plankton: Gee, and I thought you were stupid.
SpongeBob: You'll never get a Krabby Patty from me! [walks off, then stops] Even if we are friends! [runs off] Never, never, never, never!
Plankton: Oh, I'll get a Krabby Patty and you're gonna hand-deliver it to me personally! You weak-minded fool! [takes out a gramophone that plays evil music and laughs evilly to it. Cut to SpongeBob's bedroom, where SpongeBob goes to sleep]
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [Gary meows. SpongeBob goes to sleep. Just then, one of the flowers on SpongeBob's bed pattern pops up. It's Plankton in disguise, wearing a backpack that looks more like an antenna-like machine.]
Plankton: [chuckling] SpongeBob, you will be mine! [pulls out the record player and laughs evilly to it, but it actually plays a children's song of the A-B-C's.]
Woman in the recording: ♪Letters of the alphabet, A-B-C...♪
[Plankton realizes this and flips the record around. It plays the evil music like last time and he laughs. Then he walks through one of SpongeBob's holes and begins his journey. Plankton reads a map that looks like a regular road map, except with a giant brain in the middle of it.]
Plankton: It should be in here... but where? [pan out to reveal he's standing on the brain] Where? Oh... [takes off the antenna thing on his back] This will be the beginning of the end! [outside, SpongeBob rolls to his left in his sleep. The brain falls to the right inside and Plankton falls off] Ouch! Stupid brain... [gives chase] Come back here, you swine! [SpongeBob then rolls to his right. Inside, the brain squishes Plankton. SpongeBob then sleeps on his back and the brain stops rolling. Plankton holds up a roll of duct tape] That's it, brain, you're going down! [Plankton uses tape to hold it down] Yes, yes, that's grand. [takes out blueprints] And now, for my very elaborate and college-educated plan. [the blueprints reveal a picture of the antenna thing labeled "Control" and an arrow pointing to a picture of a brain labeled "Brain." Plankton follows these instructions by jamming the control in the brain] And now, it's time for a little wakey-uppy. [his hands on the control levers, he uses his foot to press the "Total Control" button. Outside, SpongeBob wakes up]
SpongeBob: Morning already? [Plankton jams the controls causing SpongeBob's legs to jam out to his side. He rumbles and falls down. Plankton laughs evilly] I... I feel a little funny today. [using the controls, he makes SpongeBob walk. Plankton laughs]
Plankton: I have you now! [outside, SpongeBob keeps walking towards the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Time for a well-balanced breakfast. [he rams through the wall and through his refrigerator, emerging with bread, a bottle of milk, and an egg carton on his head] This isn't what I had in mind. [he walks towards the straps with his pants attached] Let me just grab my pants. [he walks toward them and they spring him. He eventually gives free and keeps walking] I guess I'm not wearing any pants today. [he crashes through the side of the wall] I guess I'm not using the door either. See you later, Gary! ...I guess. [Gary meows] You're right, Gary! There is something wrong with me! Squidward! Squidward! Wake up! I need some help! [inside Squidward's house, he tries to sleep. Off-screen] Squidward! Help!
Squidward: Be quiet, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob bursts through the wall of Squidward's bedroom]
SpongeBob: Help!
Squidward: SpongeBob! What are you doing? I'm talking to you! SpongeBob! SpongeBob, are you mad? [SpongeBob crashes through the opposite wall. He stops walking and his head turns around 180 degrees]
Plankton: [through SpongeBob] Shut your mouth, you mediocre clarinet player.
Squidward: Mediocre? [from inside, Plankton speaks through a microphone]
Plankton: You pretentious, little insignificant artist. Your snivelly creations are worth less than a protozoan's waste! [SpongeBob snaps out of it]
SpongeBob: Something must be wrong with my brain! [SpongeBob's eyes roll into the back of his head and he sees Plankton. Gasps] Plankton! [Plankton raises his eyebrow] What kind of friend are you?
Plankton: Nonsense. You never liked me, anyway. You wouldn't even come to my birthday party! [from outside]
SpongeBob: Get out of my head! Leave my brain alone!
Plankton: Never! Never! [laughs and walks out backwards. Squidward faints. SpongeBob crashes through Patrick's rock and reemerges with Patrick sleeping on his head. SpongeBob throws him off and he's pinned into the ground. SpongeBob walks toward the Krusty Krab. Inside SpongeBob] Toot toot! How about a little take-out?
SpongeBob: No! No, never! [he crashes through it, reemerging with a Krabby Patty. Plankton laughs evilly] You can't fool me, Plankton, you want the Krabby Patty formula! [SpongeBob walks into the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: You are going to hand-deliver it to me personally!
SpongeBob: No, no, no! [they're inside and walk through a door] There's no one here.
Plankton: Don't remind me. Brace yourself, SpongeBob. This is my lab! [the room he's walked into has a screen with a live-action Labrador Retriever. The dog barks. They walk into the next room, a real lab] And this is my laboratory! And did I ever show you my record player? [He pulls it out again and it plays dramatic music. Plankton laughs]
SpongeBob: I must fight! [He mumbles nonsensically, stretches his head out, and bites against the side of the door. His body keeps trying to walk.]
Plankton: No, no, no, no. [He pushes the levers forward, which causes SpongeBob to lose grip and slam against the wall and wobble over to a giant funnel thing] There, you see how much easier it is when you help, friend? How do you like my analyzer? It tells the ingredients of whatever I put into it. [A robot arm clenching some seaweed comes in and drops it in the giant funnel analyzer. It has zapped and some beeping is heard from the giant computer screen. The screen, then reads what the computer says.]
Karen Plankton: Seaweed: 50% Sea, 50% Weed. [a picture of the seaweed appears]
Plankton: Impressed? Now let's reveal that secret formula. [laughs. pulls the lever forward, letting two of SpongeBob's fingers off the patty. He's holding it with both hands, so one finger from each hand] And this little piggy brought home a Krabby Patty. [two more fingers loose grip] This little piggy will help me drop it in. Any last words, SpongeBob SecretPants? [SpongeBob tries to resist, but stops]
SpongeBob: I just have to say I'm sorry I let Mr. Krabs down. [His eyes fill up with tears and leak down his cheeks] I let all of Bikini Bottom down. But worst of all, I let you down, [One of his teary eyes twinkle] you delicate little Krabby Patty.
Plankton: Mmm...
SpongeBob: [tearing up even more] With your tasty, juicy, scrumptious, warm, steamy goodness. [inside, Plankton starts to get hungry]
Plankton: Steamy... [a live-action patty gets assembled on screen as SpongeBob states the ingredients]
SpongeBob: I'll never forget your 100% all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steamed between two fluffy seaweed-sea buns. [inside, Plankton starts to drool excessively]
Plankton: Yes... yes... yes! [he jumps out of one of SpongeBob's holes to the patty] Come to papa! [he bounces off the patty and lands in the analyzer] Oh, boy... [he is zapped and the computer reads out the analysis]
Karen: Plankton: 1% evil, 99% hot gas. [Plankton appears on the screen]
Plankton: Well, this stinks.
SpongeBob: Well, patty, I guess we can go home now. [walks out]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that's my Krabby Patty! [SpongeBob walks out the swivel doors and they go back and forth] Give it back, you porous freak! I command you! My patty! [the doors come to a close] Nooooo! I'll settle for some fries. 
Squidward: Wow. Squidward, this is the best soufflé you have ever created. [blows kiss] Congratulations, chef! [gets dressed, takes a shower, gargles, and brushes his teeth. He re-enters the scene in a tuxedo and sits down at the table. He hears laughter from outside. He goes to the window and notices that SpongeBob and Patrick are playing with bubbles. SpongeBob whispers into a bubble and it floats over to Patrick and pops]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick.
[Patrick giggles as he was about to blow a bubble. He eats the bubble and whispers into another bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob where it pops]
Patrick Bubble: Hi, SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob giggles and Squidward, now annoyed, blows a bubble of his own from the liquid of his soufflé with a fork. SpongeBob whispers into another bubble]
SpongeBob: [whispering into bubble] Patrick, you're my best friend in the whole neighborhood.
[the bubble floats over but is kicked when Squidward's bubble approaches, popping SpongeBob's bubble. Squidward's bubble floats over to Patrick and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Patrick, you are the dumbest idiot it has ever been my misfortune to know.
[Patrick frowns and blows a bubble, sending it over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Do you really think that, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [whispering into the bubble] Of course, Patrick. Anyone with eyes can see that. [the bubble floats over to Patrick and pops, followed by another bubble floating back over to SpongeBob]
Patrick Bubble: Yeah? Well, I think you're ugly. [another bubble comes over and pops] Yellow is ugly! [two other bubbles, but smaller, float over and pops, both containing raspberry noises for SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [talks into the bubble, puzzled] Patrick, what are you talking about?
[The bubble floats over to Patrick. Another bubble of Squidward's bubbles floats over to SpongeBob and pops]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] SpongeBob, I no longer wish to know you. [SpongeBob gasps] You give bottom dwellers a bad name.
[Squidward creates several other bubbles and they float over to SpongeBob]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking Patrick] If I had a dollar for every brain you don't have, I'd have one dollar!
[Squidward laughs. Another bubble floats over to Patrick]
Squidward Bubble: [mimicking SpongeBob] Hey, Patrick, I heard there was a job opening down at the pet shop... as some newspaper!
Patrick: [stands up and yells at SpongeBob] Well, that makes you a big dummy, you dummy!
SpongeBob: [stands up and yells at Patrick] Yeah, well, that means that, uhh... so are you!
Patrick: Right, you're a turkey!
SpongeBob: What's that? [Squidward arrives outside with a lawn chair and his soufflé]
Patrick: It's what you are!
[Squidward begins to laugh hysterically at SpongeBob and Patrick's arguing.]
SpongeBob: Well, you're a bigger one!
Patrick: Well, you're still yellow! And you know what else is yellow?
SpongeBob: What?
Patrick: You are!
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah? Well, it doesn't matter what you call me, 'cause I never wanna see you again anyway! [he goes inside through the back door and turns around] Aww, tartar sauce! [shuts door]
[Patrick angrily opens his rock, which closes and comes up sounding like an accordion. ]
Squidward: [Laughs at Patrick. Puts the soufflé and fork in his mouth.] [Continues laughing. Moves his tentacles around in laughter, then lies back in laughter accidentally swallowing the fork and choking on it. Chokes on the fork repeatedly and his skin turns to a deep shade of blue as the letters "K" and "O" appear in his right eye and left eye respectively and flashes appears. Squidward passes out and drools]
Patrick: Wow, Squidward, you're choking! [runs over to Squidward] Uhh... uhh, I know what to do, but I should wash my hands first. Oh, well. [he takes a deep breath and performs CPR on Squidward. As he is doing this, each one of Squidward's tentacles suction cups pops up. Eventually, the fork comes out and Patrick catches it] I win!
Squidward: Wow! Patrick, you saved me!
Patrick: I did?
Squidward: Yup! You're a real lifesaver, friend! [shakes Patrick's hands]
Patrick: Friend? [holds Squidward] Friend...
Squidward: [uneasily] Yeah, Patrick, we're friends... [steps back] just friends. [they both notice SpongeBob is gazing from his window with a blank stare]
Patrick: So what are we gonna do tonight, best friend? [walks with Squidward over to the Easter Island head]
Squidward: Well, I was going to practice my clarinet solo.
Patrick: Clarinet? I love music!
[inside the pineapple, SpongeBob watches the two go inside Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Ahh, who needs them? They're no fun anyway, right, Gary? [Gary is sleeping inside his shell] Gary? [knocks on his shell]
[cut to Squidward's]
Squidward: Squidward will be performing his version of Solitude in E minor.
Patrick: [sitting on a bench while clapping] Yeah! E minor! All right! Yeah! [Squidward takes a deep breath and plays a note, and Patrick immediately falls asleep, to the annoyance of Squidward. Scene cuts to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ah, what am I worried about? I got plenty of friends! I can name three right off the bat! [he holds up three fingers] Uhh... [he draws faces on each finger with a broken smile] The gang's all here... [he looks at the faces on his fingers, and his eyes well with tears] Ohhh!
[Squidward is dragging Patrick, who is still asleep, outside. Suddenly, after a few feet, his back gives out]
Squidward: Ow! Oh! My back! I threw out my back!
SpongeBob: [sees Squidward in pain] Oh, boy, now's my chance! [jumps out of the window]
Squidward: SpongeBob? No, no, stay back!
SpongeBob: [running] Don't worry, Squidward! I'm coming!
Squidward: No, no, no, get away from me!
SpongeBob: Hang on! I'll save you! [rips off his suit revealing a speedo underneath]
Squidward: [tries to get to his door] No, no! Get away from me! No, no!
SpongeBob: [jumps off a diving board] Hold on!
Squidward: No, no! Get away! [screams as SpongeBob dives into his back cracking it back into place] Oh! I'm ruined! I'm... I'm... I'm... I-I feel great! Thanks, SpongeBob! You're a real friend! [SpongeBob smiles big]
SpongeBob: Friend...
Squidward: N-no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no-no.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squiddy, old pal. That's what friends are for. [Squidward and SpongeBob walk into the Easter Island head] So dumb Patrick fell asleep on ya, huh? Some friend. A real friend would perform for you!
Squidward: You play?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I've been playing bassinet for years! [he takes one from the wall] Give me an A, buddy! [Squidward plays a note and SpongeBob sings] Squidward is my best friend in the world. [grates strings with bow] Squidward is my best friend in the sea...
[The bow flies into what looks like Squidward's head and he screams. Fortunately, it turns out it's just a painting; the real Squidward pulls the bow out and growls as he snaps it in half with his knee]
SpongeBob: [now playing with his fingers like a guitar] Squidward...
Patrick: [pops in through the window] Likes Patrick more than SpongeBob. [SpongeBob slams the window in Patrick's face] Oh!
SpongeBob: [strums harder before slamming the bass to the floor] And Patrick is a dirty, stinky, rotten friend stealer! [smashes the bass] Umm, I can fix this. [Squidward is steaming red in fury]
Squidward: Grrrrrryehhhhherrrryeh! [he kicks SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: ...So, uhh, I'll see you tomorrow, Squidward! Call me!
Squidward: Yech! That was disgusting! I feel like I need to scrub myself. [opens up the curtain and screams after he sees Patrick in his tub]
Patrick: Hey, buddy. I warmed it up for ya. [shows him a brush and soap]
Squidward: Patrick! Get out! And put some clothes on! [SpongeBob peeks in through the upstairs window]
SpongeBob: What's the matter, Squidward, old buddy? [notices Patrick in the bath-tub] Oh, ho-ho! So this is what I find, huh?! My best friend and my ex-best friend and... [shown bath toys] ...rubber bath toys!
Patrick: [simultaneously] Oh, yeah?! Well, he was my friend first!
SpongeBob: [simultaneously] You're just a backbiting, backstabbing silly blob of...
Squidward: [screams] This can't be happening to me! [He runs away. SpongeBob and Patrick stop their arguing as they notice Squidward's gone]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward!
SpongeBob: Buddy!
Patrick: Squidward, where are you?!
SpongeBob: Where'd ya go, friend?
Patrick: Where are ya, ol' buddy?
Squidward: [hiding in a trash can] Oh, this is nuts! I need a plan to get those two back together and outta my hair!
SpongeBob: [reading a magazine as the doorbell rings a letter is pushed under the door. Then he smells it] Squidward. [opens it] A dinner party? I'd love to! [SpongeBob knocks on Squidward's door and Squidward opens it] Did you miss me?
Squidward: Come on in! You look stunning. [shuts door]
SpongeBob: I'd much rather dine with you than that lousy... [gasps when he sees Patrick] Say, what gives?! I'm not sitting near that maniac!
Patrick: Me neither! This was a setup!
Squidward: I thought you two were my best friends.
SpongeBob and Patrick: I am your best friend!
Squidward: [takes out a bottle of soda] Well, how about some soda, guys? [SpongeBob shows him his glass]
SpongeBob: Yes, please! [Squidward gives him some soda] Thanks, friend. [flicks Squidward's nose] [drinks]
Patrick: How about some for your best friend? [SpongeBob puts his glass in front of Patrick's, so he gets the soda instead of Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thanks, best friend! [drinks]
Patrick: Can I have some now, buddy?
SpongeBob: Wait, I need some more! [pours SpongeBob another glass]
Patrick: I still didn't get any! [SpongeBob gives Patrick his soda]
SpongeBob: There ya go. More please! [Squidward fills his glass as SpongeBob drinks it really fast]
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward! [shows Squidward his glass again, but it's still full] Squidward!
Squidward: Patrick! Your glass is full!
Patrick: Oh, yeah...
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
SpongeBob: [shows Squidward his glass] Squidward!
Patrick: [shows Squidward his glass] Hey, Squidward!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [both show Squidward their glasses] Squidward!
Squidward: Sorry, boys, I'm all out of pop. I'm gonna go get some more. [walks away] Why don't you just stay here and chat? [closes door. Then we see SpongeBob and Patrick. They are extremely fat and not wanting to look at each other. Then SpongeBob hiccups and a bubble floats up and pops that sounds like a burp. Both of them laugh and the entire house is full of bubbles as Squidward walks up to his door with a grocery bag. Then an explosion and crashing sounds are heard] I should just walk away right now. [opens door to find his house destroyed] What a surprise... I invited them in, and I left them alone. Well, Squidward, what have we learned today? [pieces around the door break]
SpongeBob: Guess what, Squidward? [both hug]
Patrick: Me and SpongeBob are friends again!
Squidward: Great, now go be friends somewhere else.
SpongeBob: Don't you want us to help you clean this up a little?
Squidward: No! Out! [both walk out]
SpongeBob: Psst, I think he's jealous.
Patrick: How pathetic. [Squidward shuts door hard and when he turns around as a bubble comes and pops on the door which causes the door to fall on his back]
Squidward: Ohhhhh, my back. 
[SpongeBob's foghorn alarm goes off]
SpongeBob: This is it, Gary!
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed bounces up and flings SpongeBob onto the calendar, where he lands on March 3rd with the words "boating exam today!" on it then drops to the floor]
SpongeBob: The big boating exam is today! I've never felt so capable! [A door opens from underneath him. He comes out of his house riding a unicycle] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. Squidward! Squidward!
Squidward: What?
SpongeBob: I'm ready, Squidward! [SpongeBob rides his unicycle around Squidward's house]
Squidward: Ready to move?
SpongeBob: No, I'm ready to pass my boating test. [Rides his unicycle towards the school] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready... [stops his unicycle near a dumpster and jumps off of it] I'm ready-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-eady-ready. Well, pal, I won't be needing you anymore. [throws the unicycle into the dumpster] I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready! Oh, yeah! I'm ready!
Gus: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Hey, I just got my license!
SpongeBob: [snaps fingers] Hey, I'm getting mine next!
Gus: Hey, I doubt it! [walks off]
SpongeBob: Okay, see you on the road. I'm ready! Here I come, Mrs. Puff! I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready. [jumps around the boardwalk]
Mrs. Puff: [sighs] I'm not ready. [opens the door]
SpongeBob: Hi, Mrs. Puff! Today is the day I'm going to pass my boating exam!
Mrs. Puff: [with clipboard and pen in hand] We'll see about that, SpongeBob. First we must...
SpongeBob: First I must pass the oral exam. I am confident in my abilities to successfully succeed.
Mrs. Puff: I know. Okay, #1: What is the front of the boat?
SpongeBob: The bow. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: What is the back?
SpongeBob: Stern. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answer]
Mrs. Puff: #3: Right is...
SpongeBob: Starboard. [answers the remaining questions] Port. Skipper. Deck. Cabin. Galley. Keel. 1924. [Mrs. Puff writes down his answers]
Mrs. Puff: You've passed the oral test. What a surprise! [gets in the boat and secures herself tightly] Now it's time to once again take the driving portion of the exam. Okay, SpongeBob, get in the boat.
SpongeBob: Oh, in this boat right here? [looks at his watch] Is it time already?
Mrs. Puff: Get in the boat, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Oh yeah, absolutely. [gets in]
Mrs. Puff: All you have to do is get on the track. [looks ahead to the track that gets longer and longer] Okay, SpongeBob, what's the first thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Mrs. Puff: No, no. First thing is to start the boat. [Mrs. Puff turns the engine on and SpongeBob goes crazy] SpongeBob? SpongeBob? Relax, it's only the boat.
SpongeBob: The boat?
Mrs. Puff: Okay, now what do you do next?
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: Yes... no, no! Don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: No, no, don't, don't floor it.
SpongeBob: Okay, floor it.
Mrs. Puff: No! No! [SpongeBob pushes the accelerator down and starts driving backwards really fast by some spectators and drives into a lighthouse. After crashing, Mrs. Puff inflates and becomes big and round with a deep voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why?
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: [in his bed] I don't know why, Gary. I don't know. I'm tired of failing that boating test. I've already taken it thirty-seven times.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Okay, thirty-eight. [puts his pillow on his head]
Gary: [puts on SpongeBob's boots] Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary, I'm not walking.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie in SpongeBob's bed] SpongeBob, this is star ranger, over.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] What is it, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] I got a surprise for you.
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Oh, Patrick, I'm not in the mood.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Get out of bed. [SpongeBob gets out of bed]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, now what, Patrick?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Go to your closet for a surprise. [SpongeBob slides down a room and stands up in front of his closet door]
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, I'm at the closet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Listen carefully. What's pink and square at the same time?
SpongeBob: [through walkie-talkie] I don't know, Patrick. [SpongeBob opens the closet door and Patrick has one of SpongeBob's SquarePants on]
Patrick: Patrick SquarePants!
SpongeBob: [deadpan] Pat, don't do that. [sits in a chair] I've got too much to worry about.
Patrick: What's the problem?
SpongeBob: I can't pass my boating exam. I've taken it thirty-seven...
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: ...uhh, thirty-eight times. I know all the answers... [Patrick's square pants rip off] ...until I get behind the wheel. I just need something to help me think straight.
Patrick: Thinking straight is what I do. You drive and I'll do all the thinking for you. [takes SpongeBob's walkie-talkie]
SpongeBob: How are we going to do that? [Patrick puts a walkie-talkie into SpongeBob's head with the antenna coming out of the top]
Patrick: Come in, SpongeBob. Hello? Hello?
SpongeBob: Hey! I can hear you in my head! This is great! While I'm taking the test, you can give me all the answers. [SpongeBob notices the antenna sticking out] Wait a minute, Patrick. Won't I look silly with this antenna coming out of my head? [Patrick puts a tall hat over the antenna. Next, we see a big telescope peeking out SpongeBob's upstairs window]
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Pat to Sponge, Pat to Sponge, testing, testing. [looking through the telescope at SpongeBob] Testing, testing, testing, testing, testing, testing! Testing! [loudly] Testing! [screams] Test. Do you read?!
SpongeBob: Sponge to Pat, I read you loud and clear, over.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Got your apple ready? [SpongeBob shows an apple] Lucky undergarments? Hold on. Hold on. [Patrick focuses in on the underwear with the telescope to reveal the word lucky on the top of it] Bingo! Underwear, apple, and me. You're ready to get that license. Uh-oh, here comes Mrs. Puff! Act natural. [SpongeBob jumps out of the boat and on the ground and starts chewing grass]
SpongeBob: Moo.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, get in the boat! [SpongeBob jumps in the boat. A siren is heard as Mrs. Puff comes out an ambulance and into the boat] Give her the apple. [SpongeBob gives her the apple]
SpongeBob: Here you go, ma'am. [Mrs. Puff throws apple in her mouth and swallows]
Mrs. Puff: Let's get this over with. [takes a deep breath] What's the first thing you do? [puts hands and arms over head for protection]
SpongeBob: Uhh...
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Start the boat. [SpongeBob pushes a button that starts the boat causing Mrs. Puff to go crazy]
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff. Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Whoa-ho! Huh? What?
SpongeBob: It's okay, it's only the boat.
Mrs. Puff: The boat? You started the boat?
SpongeBob: I... I think so.
Mrs. Puff: Oh. Well... what's the second thing you do?
SpongeBob: 1924?
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] No, no, put it in drive.
SpongeBob: Put it in drive?
Mrs. Puff: Yes, yes, yes! [SpongeBob pushes lever down to drive] Put it in drive. Then what?
SpongeBob: [lifts leg up] Floor it?
Mrs. Puff: No! [screams] No!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Freeze, mister! [SpongeBob stops] Big toe. [SpongeBob's big toe pops out of his shoe and gently pushes the accelerator down]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, gracious. Oh, gracious! Oh-oh. Ha-ha! Ah, we haven't crashed yet.
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Okay, you're coming to your first turn. [giant wall with the word wall on it is shown and a left curve]
Mrs. Puff: Oh no, the first turn. Please, tell me you know what to do at the first turn!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Left! [SpongeBob turns left]
Mrs. Puff: Oh!
Patrick: [through walkie-talkie] Right! [SpongeBob turns right]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! Oh my, this is splendid, SpongeBob. You're doing fine.
Montage: [SpongeBob stops at a stop sign and looks both ways before starting to drive again. Then drives around with his left arm out making a signal. Patrick still talking to SpongeBob through the walkie-talkie as SpongeBob drives over a big hill in the road. As Mrs. Puff writes a couple things on her clipboard, Patrick is putting on another pair of SquarePants. SpongeBob pulls back on the boat and the boat jumps in the air over a big anchor. Patrick finds SpongeBob's diary and begins to read and laugh at it as SpongeBob jumps off a ramp through a ring of fire. Fred is walking across the course but SpongeBob stops the boat and helps him walk across. He gets back in the boat as Patrick is eating out of SpongeBob's fridge. SpongeBob is sitting back and driving with his feet and driving upside down.]
Mrs. Puff: Splendid! Wonderful! [sign that reads finish line is just ahead] There's the finish line. It's unbelievable. You've shown the most spectacular improvement of any student I've ever seen. What's your secret? A little radio in your head? [everyone laughs] Oh, and under that hat is some kind of, uhh, antenna? [everyone laughs] And some guy miles away from here is giving you all the answers? [everyone laughs] Oh, yes, but that would be cheating. [SpongeBob opens his eyes wide realizing he is cheating]
Patrick: Cheating! [laughing hysterically]
SpongeBob: I'm cheating?! Mrs Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Yes, my star pupil?
SpongeBob: I think I'm cheating.
Mrs. Puff: What's that, dear? [SpongeBob takes a hold of Mrs. Puff]
SpongeBob: I think I am cheating!
Mrs. Puff: You've... you've let go of the wheel.
SpongeBob: I do have an antenna under my hat! [shows antennae under hat] There is a guy giving me all the answers! It's all true! [crying] I'm cheating! I'm cheating! I'm cheating!
Patrick: What?! [Patrick runs out of SpongeBob's house and back under his rock, crying]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mrs. Puff! I'm sorry!
Mrs. Puff: [packing] The wheel, SpongeBob! The wheel...
SpongeBob: Cheating... I'm a cheater! Cheater...
Mrs. Puff: No, no, no! It's quite alright! You can cheat that way!
SpongeBob: No... I'm cheating...!
Mrs. Puff: At least, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Cheating!
Mrs. Puff: Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: I'm a cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater!
Mrs. Puff: It's okay to cheat today!
SpongeBob: No...!
Mrs. Puff: That way! Cheat that way!
SpongeBob: Cheater...! [crashes off screen into the lighthouse again, Mrs. Puff inflates again]
Mrs. Puff: [manly voice] Oh, SpongeBob, why?
SpongeBob: Mrs. Puff, I think I cheated.
Fred: My leg!
SpongeBob: Uhh, I'm sorry for letting you down again, Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: It's okay, SpongeBob, you didn't mean it. Okay, boys, take me away. [EMTs shove Mrs. Puff into the ambulance]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mrs. Puff. I'll try harder next semester. [Mrs. Puff screams as she is taken away by the ambulance] It'll be great! [walks away] Only now I don't even have my bike.
Gary: [with SpongeBob's bike] Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! My bike! You found it! This sponge is still mobile! [rides away on his bike] Alright, let's go surprise someone at the hospital!
Squidward: [The scene starts at the Krusty Krab with SpongeBob cleaning a table] Hurry up with those chairs, SpongeBob. It's after closing and I'd like to go home!
[phone rings] 


SpongeBob: I got it, I got it! Coming. [leaps for the phone but Squidward answers it first. SpongeBob falls to the floor and exclaims]
Squidward: Hello? Sorry, sir, we're close... [Mr. Krabs snatches phone]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, Krusty Krab. How could I help you? [customer explains order over phone] Pizza? [eyes turn into dollar signs] Um... Of course we have pizza.
Squidward: Uhh, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: Our delivery squid will bring it right over. [hangs up]
Squidward: Mr. Krabs, we don't serve pizza. [Mr. Krabs gets a plate of Krabby patties and turns it into pizza. Then he puts it in a box] We don't deliver.
Mr. Krabs: We don't deliver, [gives Squidward the pizza] but you do.
Squidward: Can't you just get SpongeBob to do it?
Mr. Krabs: Great idea! Take him with you. [SpongeBob sneaks over smiling big]
Squidward: That's not what I had in mind!
SpongeBob: Front end... check. Antenna... [touches the boat antenna making it vibrate] check. Bumper... check. Bumper sticker... [bumper sticker says "I Brake For Sea Urchins"] ...check. [uncaps the tire pressure and puts his mouth in it, causing him to inflate like a balloon, and talk in a squeaky, high pitched voice while he is now the size of a giant parade balloon] Tire pressure! [blows out the rest of the pressure in Squidward's face, returning him to his normal size and voice] ...check. Vehicle inspection complete! We're really making history here, Squidward. That lucky customer is going to get the first Krabby Patty Pizza ever!
Squidward: Good, then you drive.
SpongeBob: I can't. I'm still in Boating School.
Squidward: Come on, SpongeBob. It's just around the corner.
SpongeBob: Well, yeah, but...
Squidward: Just do what you do in school.
SpongeBob: Well, okay. Wait, don't tell me.
Squidward: Back it up.
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: Back... it up.
SpongeBob: Right, back... it up. [tries to move the stick shift down]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay.
Squidward: Shift into reverse, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Reverse? Oh, yeah, reverse. [SpongeBob imagines the words "FORWARD" and "BACKWARD" turning into Korean characters, 앞으로가 (FORWARD) and 뒤로가 (BACKWARD)]
Squidward: Back it up!
SpongeBob: [shifts gears] Backing up! Backing up! [boat backs up really fast]
Squidward: [tries to get the wheel] Gimme the wheel, SpongeBob. Give me the wheel!
SpongeBob: Backing up! Backing up! Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ack-i-i-i-i-i-ng up! [they go over a bumpy area with rocks and then they spin around and around and around, screaming. The next morning, the boat goes over five hills] Backing up. Backing up. Backing up. [boat stops with no fuel left] Backing up.
Squidward: Well... you backed up. And you know what? I think we're out of gas. And you know what else? [echoing] We're in the middle of nowhere!
SpongeBob: And you know what else else? I think the pizza's getting cold.
Squidward: And the pizza's cold? Oh, the pizza's cold. Not the pizza! Oh, how could it get any worse?! [kicks boat and the boat's gasoline becomes full again and it drives away into the distance without them]
SpongeBob: Well, we can still deliver it on foot. [Squidward narrows his eyes. Later, both walk on the sand]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: [singing] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza...
Squidward: ...And my feet are killing me. Whoa. [trips over SpongeBob, who is lying on the ground] SpongeBob? What are you doing?
SpongeBob: [rubbing the ground] It's an old pioneer trick. I saw it in a movie once.
Squidward: SpongeBob, this is no time for...
SpongeBob: Shh, shh, shh. It's working.
Squidward: What is it?
SpongeBob: [pointing to the road] Truck! Sixteen wheels. Now I can show you how the pioneers hitchhiked. [starts dancing in the road while wearing a hat] Whee... eee... [Squidward sits on a rock while playing with a wooden spoon]
Truck Driver: Crashin' frashin' break dancers! [honks his truck]
Squidward: He's stopping! He's stopping! [Squidward realizes he's not stopping and grabs SpongeBob out of the way where they are covered in sand thanks to the truck. Squidward narrows his eyes at the smiling SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Squidward are now in a place with heavy winds] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza for you and me. The Krusty Krab pizza [The wind blows on Squidward's nose making it touch his face so he puts it down, only for it to touch his face again so he puts it in his mouth.] is the pizza free delivery. The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza very ta-asty. [SpongeBob gets carried around in the air by the huge winds]
Squidward: Will you let go of that stupid pizza, already?!
SpongeBob: [still being carried around in the air] I can't, it's for the customer!
Squidward: Well, who cares about the customer?!
SpongeBob: I do!
Squidward: Well, I don't!
SpongeBob: [wind stops and SpongeBob gasps] Squidward! [starts flying again]
Squidward: Let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! [runs over Squidward]
Squidward: Ow. [holding SpongeBob's legs] SpongeBob, let go of that pizza!
SpongeBob: No! It's for the customer!
Squidward: SpongeBob! Let go of the pizza! [lifts up into the tornado]
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob! [looks down] Hang onto the pizza! [tornado spits them both out. SpongeBob uses the pizza as a parachute but Squidward falls hard onto the ground] Hey! Hey! [crawls up to the screen] Where's the road? Where's the road? [a tumbleweed rolls by] We're doomed! How are we gonna get home, which way do we go? [SpongeBob lands] What are we gonna do now! There's no road here!
SpongeBob: I think town's this way. [points]
Squidward: Oh, don't tell me, Jethro. The pioneers?
SpongeBob: That's right. [points to a mossy rock] Moss always points to civilization.
Squidward: That way? That way there? [SpongeBob nods] So, let me get this straight... you think that we should go that way?
SpongeBob: [nods again] Yep.
Squidward: Well, then I'm going this way. [heads the other way]
SpongeBob: Huh? Squid, wait! I don't think...
Squidward: Trust me, I know where I'm going. [Pans out to show another city in the other direction]
SpongeBob: [sings] The Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, absolutivally. [later] pizza... [starts beatboxing] pizza... [later, SpongeBob is walking backwards. SpongeBob's pants almost split into two and move up and down simultaneously while he continues to beatbox. Still later] Krusty Krab pizza is the pizza, yeah, for you and [falsetto] me! [later] Krab Pizza... for you. Krus... the Krusshy and the... Krab and the... pizza inside. [Later, they are both lying face down in the sand]
Squidward: Sponge, we gotta eat something.
SpongeBob: I heard in times of hardship, the pioneers would eat coral. [Squidward eats some coral] No, maybe it wasn't coral. [Squidward spits out the coral] Maybe it was sand, no, no, mud.
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: Wait, I remember now. It was coral!
Squidward: Give it to me!
SpongeBob: No, we promised it's for the customer.
Squidward: [fancy music plays] You're right. It's for the customer.
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: Maybe we better check on it, make sure it's okay.
SpongeBob: Well?
Squidward: Just a peek. [opens box]
SpongeBob: [he shuts it quickly] Okay, it's fine.
Squidward: No, I think I saw something. [opens box] Oh, no. I was wrong. It looks okay. Sure is a fine-looking pizza.
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: What's that? Is that the cheese?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: And the pepperoni?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Squidward: [SpongeBob slurps] Oh, looks good, huh?
SpongeBob: Wait a second, I know what you're trying to do, Squidward. [closes box] I'm not letting you eat the pizza!
Squidward: Give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Don't make me take it away from you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Get away!
Squidward: [chases SpongeBob] Get back here, SpongeBob, give me the pizza!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: No!
Squidward: Wait! [he becomes too tired to run]
SpongeBob: No! No! [runs into Squidward]
Squidward: I want that pizza and you're gonna hand it over one way or another!
SpongeBob: Look, we're saved!
Squidward: Sure, we're saved. Now give me some pizza!
SpongeBob: No, really Squid, we're saved! We're saved! We're saved! [he jumps in and out of his pants]
Squidward: Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: [to a conga beat] Saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! [rips himself apart then the two parts go in circles and then they connect again. SpongeBob starts doing a conga dance] Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, saved, saved, saved, saved, saved! Saved, we are saved!
Squidward: That's just a stupid boulder!
SpongeBob: It's not just a boulder. [sniff] It's a rock. [cries] A rock! A rock! Its a big beautiful, old rock. [climbs up it and rubs it] Oh, the pioneers used to ride these babies for miles, and it's in great shape.
Squidward: SpongeBob, will you forget the stupid pioneers?! Have you ever noticed that there are none of them left? That's because they were lousy hitchhikers, ate coral and took directions from algae! And now, you're telling me they thought they could drive... [SpongeBob runs over Squidward with the boulder] ...rocks? Hold on there, Jethro!
SpongeBob: [they stop outside the customer's house] I can't wait to see the look on our customer’s face! [rings doorbell]
Tom: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Congratulations, sir. Your Krabby Patty pizza is here!
Tom: Wow, thanks! I've been dying for one of these. It... [brief pause] Where's my drink?
SpongeBob: [confused] What drink?
Tom: [in an angry tone] My drink? My diet Dr. Kelp? Don't tell me you forgot my drink!
SpongeBob: [checks through the order] But, you didn't order any...
Tom: [yelling] How am I supposed to eat this pizza without my drink?!
SpongeBob: But... but... [tears start rolling down his face]
Tom: Didn't you ever once think of the customer?! [throws the pizza at SpongeBob's face] You call yourself a delivery boy?! Well, I ain't buying! [slams the door. SpongeBob goes over to Squidward, smiling and trying not to cry]
Squidward: Sponge? Sponge? It's okay. Sponge? [SpongeBob drops the pizza, falls over, starts sobbing, and absorbs his tears over and over] Sponge? [Squidward gets angry, grabs the pizza, stomps towards the customer's house and pounds on the door]
Tom: [answers the door, still angry] Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't paying for that!
Squidward: [Tom's point of view] Well, this one's on the house! [slams the pizza box in Tom's face]
SpongeBob: [still crying] Did he change his mind?
Squidward: [smugly] He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite.
SpongeBob: [stops crying] No drink?
Squidward: Nah. Now take me home. [jumps up on the rock]
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? We have just enough time to make it back to work. [backs up the rock where they are instantly at the Krusty Krab]
Squidward: Work? [screen cuts to black] Oh, my aching tentacles!
Nematodes: Walking, walking, walking, walking. [continue to repeat "walking"]
Nematode #1: Hungry!
Nematodes: Hungry, hungry, hungry, hungry. [continue to repeat "hungry." All eat a whole large piece of coral]
Nematode #1: Still hungry!
Nematodes: Still hungry, still hungry, still hungry, still hungry. [continue to repeat "still hungry." All eat a truck that drives by, leaving the driver floating]
Fred: Naw, dang nematodes!
Nematode #1: Thirsty!
Nematodes: Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty. [continue to repeat "thirsty." They all bounce to SpongeBob's house and take out some straws. Then start drinking up the pineapple house. SpongeBob and Gary are still sleeping as everything begins to shrink inside, even Gary's food bowl]
Gary: Meow. [SpongeBob's bed begins to shrink as he wakes up]
SpongeBob: Hooray, Gary! We're finally huge!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? Wait a minute! Oh no! [squeezes through the door as he tries to get to the phone. Gary gets stuck in the door]
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Shellphone! I know, I'll call Squidward. He'll know what to do!
Squidward: [on the other line] Hello?
SpongeBob: Squidward!
Squidward: Is it time already for you to ruin my day?
SpongeBob: [as he talks to Squidward, his voice gets higher and higher and starts talking faster until the shellphone completely disappears] Squidward! Help me! My house is shrinking and I woke up this morning and it was getting smaller and smaller... [high-pitched squeaky talking. Then the phone call is disconnected] Oh no!
Squidward: Yep, it is. [SpongeBob screams]
Patrick: [comes out from his rock] Is it time already to ruin Squid's day? [falls off rock onto his furniture, then jumps out with a tuxedo and tophat on] Hey, SpongeBob, don't start without me!
Nematodes: [continue sucking on SpongeBob's house, then they all burp and leave]
SpongeBob: Ohh... nematodes. [sees a seed on the ground, then picks it up] The only thing left of my house is this little pebble. [Patrick and Squidward walk up]
Squidward: What's going on here?
SpongeBob: I've got bad news, guys! Look at what happened to my house! It's gone! It's all gone. What am I going to do? Where am I going to live?
Squidward: [smiling] Yeah...
Patrick: [his eyes bulge excessively in surprise] Hey, SpongeBob, your house is gone!
Squidward: Well, what can I say? [begins to shake SpongeBob's hand] It's been great knowing you, SpongeBob. Good luck, somewhere else. [walks back to his house] [sarcastically talks] I'm gonna miss you. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo. [party favors fly out Squidward's windows as he parties] Boo-hoo! [starts to laugh]
Patrick: Squid's taking it real hard. So what are you gonna do now?
SpongeBob: I guess I'll have to move back with my mom and dad. [shown a picture of SpongeBob's parents smiling]
Patrick: No, wait a minute, no you don't. [shown picture of SpongeBob's parents frowning] We can build you a new house!
SpongeBob: We can't build a house!
Patrick: Well, sure, it's easy! I built my house all by myself! [antenna on Patrick's rock falls off]
SpongeBob: Alright, Patrick, lets get to work! [zoom in on SpongeBob and Patrick as construction workers]
Patrick: [Patrick tries to hit a nail into a board, but hits his hand instead] Ow! Ow! Ow! [SpongeBob takes two buckets of paint, one red and one green. He pours the red paint on his backside and pours the green paint on his front side. He puts one side on a fence so that the paint gets on it, and then he does the other side the same way. He does this twice. As he tightens a loose bolt, the screen turns every time SpongeBob tightens the bolt sending Patrick sliding, falling upside down towards the sky, then back onto the ground right side up. SpongeBob nails pieces of wooden boards together in midair, and a piece falls off and lands on Patrick's hand, leading him to say "Ow!" each time. Patrick moves his board under the next board, which falls down on his hand. This happens several times. Next, shown SpongeBob's finished house, shown also with sparkles]
Patrick: [Patrick gives a big thumbs up with bandages wrapped around his thumb] We're done!
SpongeBob: Yeah! So what do you think?
Patrick: [SpongeBob's built house sparkles a bit] I wish I lived there.
SpongeBob: Really?
Patrick: No. [SpongeBob puts the small pineapple on his head]
SpongeBob: One bedroom. [nose sticks out through the door and the pineapple breaks into pieces]
Patrick: Tartar sauce.
SpongeBob: [pets Gary] Well, looks like we've got to move back with Mom and Pop.
Patrick: Well, you can't move back in with your parents! When my parents kicked me out of the house, I never went back. Wait! You and Gary can come stay with me!
SpongeBob: That'd be great!
Patrick: Yeah! We'll be rockmates! [SpongeBob and Patrick get ready to sleep under Patrick's rock] Good night, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Good night, rockmate.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary. [SpongeBob goes to sleep but then is awaken to Patrick's snoring] Oh...what the...? [Gary hides in his shell and SpongeBob puts a cork in the sides of his head, and goes back to sleep. The wind blows and Patrick shivers, he then pulls the rock closer to him, SpongeBob shivers in the cold and pulls it back over himself. Gary sits on top of the rock as they keep pulling it back and forth until Patrick keeps the rock closer to him. SpongeBob gets cold and he covers himself with sand on and goes to sleep. Patrick starts drooling heavily, filling his mouth, and flows like a stream over to SpongeBob. As SpongeBob snores, he absorbs the drool coming from Patrick and becomes a fat sponge. He waddles over to Patrick and removes the corks, spilling Patrick's drool out of him and down-sizing him to normal size. Then he takes out a bigger cork and puts it in Patrick's mouth and goes back to sleep. Patrick struggles, then spits out the cork]
Patrick: [in his sleep] A spider! Spiders! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! [lifts rock and starts smashing SpongeBob with it several times, he then goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick, no, Patrick! Wake up! Wake up! It's me, SpongeBob! [moves away from the rock a few feet and goes back to sleep]
Patrick: Spiders! Spiders! [picks up his rock, runs over to SpongeBob, and smashes him repeatedly with the rock]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [Patrick goes back to sleep]
SpongeBob: [in Squidward's house, he stands next to Squidward, holding Gary, as Squidward sleeps, he taps Squidward's nose as he whispers] Squidward? Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] H-h-huh?
SpongeBob: Squidward?
Squidward: [sleepily] Whoa. Huh? Wha-what?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could we stay here a couple of days or a month or two?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, yeah, wha-wha-whatever.
SpongeBob: Thanks. Thanks, Squidward. [gets in bed with Squidward] Squidward, could you scoot over a little?
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh, oh, yeah, sure. [scoots over to the side]
SpongeBob: While you're at it, could you get me a glass of water?
Squidward: [sleepily] Okay. Hmmm, yeah, sure. [Sleepily talks a bit, gets out of bed and walks off, then comes back with a glass of water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, this is a real swell place you got here. [Squidward hands SpongeBob the glass] Thanks, buddy.
Squidward: [sleepily] Uh-huh. Y-you're welcome. [SpongeBob drinks the water]
SpongeBob: Yeah, I like sleepovers.
Squidward: [sleepily] Yeah. Me, too.
SpongeBob: Yep, this is great. Good night, Squidward.
Squidward: [yawns] Good night, SpongeBob. [Squidward's eyes pop open. Squidward opens the door and SpongeBob and Gary walk out] [unhappy] Good night, SpongeBob. [the next day, Squidward opens his eyes excitedly] Tum-ta-dum! Today's the big day, Squidward! Don't wanna be late! [he flies into his closet, gets dressed, and goes outside] Gotta hurry! Hold it! Hold everything! [SpongeBob and Patrick stand outside, with bags] I would not want to miss this. The day SpongeBob moves! I can't believe it's really happening.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Squidward. I'll come visit you.
Squidward: Don't try to cheer me up, SpongeBob. [changes his smile to a frown briefly] Please.
SpongeBob: Here come my parents. [Patrick beings to cry and the car horn sounds as SpongeBob's parents drive up]
Mrs. SquarePants: SpongeBob! Hi, honey, we're here!
Mr. SquarePants: Come on, SpongeBob, hurry, hurry, son, your mother has dinner waiting.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mom.
Squidward: Hello, Mrs. SquarePants! Let me help you with these bags. [picks up the bags and carries them to the car]
SpongeBob: Just give me a minute. [walks back to where his house used to be] I cannot hold onto you any longer, little pebble. [buries it into the ground in the middle of where his house used to be] You hold too many memories. [as he starts to cry, a tear falls from his nose and into the ground where the seed absorbs it, it then starts to glow. Then SpongeBob shakes Squidward's hand] Well, Squidward, this is goodbye. [walks away]
Squidward: Goodbye, SpongeBob, goodbye. [dances] Goodbye, SpongeBob. Bye-bye-bye. Goodbye, SpongeBob. Ha-ha. Goodbye, goodbye. [Patrick lies on the ground, bawling, as SpongeBob gets in the car]
Mrs. Squarepants: Come on, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Goodbye, Patrick. Goodbye, Bikini Bottom. [Patrick holds onto the back of the boat, lifting the front into the air, as he cries]
Squidward: [still dancing] SpongeBob is leaving. He's leaving, he's leaving! [the seed shakes violently] La, la, la, la, la, la, la ha ha ha ha! [the seed shakes even more violently] He leaving, ha ha! [seed still shakes] SpongeBob is leaving, he's leaving! [Squidward stops dancing as the ground starts shaking, a giant green stem grows out of the ground, SpongeBob's house grows from the plant and drops where his old house used to be and on Squidward. The stem then goes back into the ground]
SpongeBob: My house is back! [SpongeBob, his parents, and Patrick all happily run into the pineapple] Aww! Good old pineapple! It was exactly where it used to be! [continues praising all of the returned belongings he possessed in his original house. SpongeBob returns to Squidward lying under the floor] Aww, Squidward, isn't this great? I'm back forever!
Squidward: [muffled] Forever?
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man: Fleet and forceful. With the ability to assemble and charge the creatures of the deep.
Mermaid Man: By the power of Neptune!
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man, with his young associate Barnacle Boy, fights for all creatures who live in the sea, against the forces of evil.
Villain: [holds a baby's lollipop and he spots the whirlpool] Oh, no! The Raging Whirlpool! [the whirlpool catches him and the lollipop falls on the baby's tongue]
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man! Champion of the deep.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yay! Champion of the deep! Woo!
SpongeBob: [dressed up as Mermaid Man] Come on, Barnacle Boy. There's evil afoot.
Patrick: [dressed up as Barnacle Boy] Leaping lampreys, Mermaid Man! I'm right behind you!
[SpongeBob and Patrick outside and sneak behind Squidward, who's relaxing on a lounge chair wearing sunglasses]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy spot their arch enemy, Reflecto, up to no good.
Squidward: SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: You know what this means.
Patrick: Donuts.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooohh.
SpongeBob: By the power of Neptune. [Patrick bites into the donut]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite!
SpongeBob: Creatures of the deep, assemble! [both go into deep thinking] Think... harder... Barnacle Boy. [jellyfish swims by] Here they come. [Squidward blows jellyfish away]
SpongeBob: Blast, Reflecto has become too powerful.
Squidward: [under a tent] What the? Ohh!
SpongeBob: If Reflecto is cut off from sunlight, he becomes weak.
Patrick: Jumping jellyfish, Mermaid Man. He's destroying the shield!
[Cut to Squidward destroying the tent in a fury]
SpongeBob: Quick, Barnacle Boy, back to the sea cave.
Patrick: Right, Mermaid Man.
Squidward: [runs to the door and he knocks it hard] SpongeBob! SpongeBob, open up!
SpongeBob: [Squidward continues knocking the door] Reflecto has found our secret lab.
Patrick: What would the real Mermaid Man do?
Squidward: Why don't you go ask him yourself?
SpongeBob: Elaborate, you vile fiend.
Squidward: He and Barnacle Boy live in the retirement home on the other side of town.
SpongeBob: Hmm, they must be working undercover.
Squidward: Yeah... now please leave me alone.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick bites into the donut again] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, reunite! [At Shady Shoals Retirement Home]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I know that Mermaid Man is working undercover on an important case, but you think we can see him?
Manager: Undercover? Yeah... well, I'll see if they can take time from their busy schedule to see you. [SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing as they walk in] There they are. Right over there. [SpongeBob and Patrick gasp]
Manager: Try not to surprise them.
SpongeBob: Patrick! Can you believe it?
Patrick: [holding onto SpongeBob] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in the flesh! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk in front of the TV]
Barnacle Boy: Hey, who are those guys?
Mermaid Man: Uhh, are they here to fix the TV?
Barnacle Boy: What do you want?
SpongeBob: Are you Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: Well, we used to be. But now we're retired.
SpongeBob: But you can't retire! There's evil afoot!
Mermaid Man: Wha? Evil! Evil! [hanging on a coral pot] Barnacle Boy! Come quick! I've got the evil!
SpongeBob: All I said was, there's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: Evil! Evil! E...
Barnacle Boy: Would you please stop saying that?
Mermaid Man: [hanging on a water fountain] Evil! Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil! [water squirts at him] Death raaaaay! [the manager comes, grabs SpongeBob and Patrick and throws them out]
SpongeBob: Wow, Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
Patrick: It's too bad they're old.
SpongeBob: What do you mean, Patrick? Old people are the greatest. They're full of wisdom and experience. [real life captain gives a thumbs up and triumphant music plays] The world needs Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Someone, somewhere, is in trouble, and I won't rest until Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy are out of retirement. [fireworks appear]
Patrick: Ooh! Pretty lights!
[At Shady Shoals Retirement Home's cafeteria]
Mermaid Man: To the meatloaf! To the broccoli! Make sure you give extra broccoli to my young ward. The boy needs his vitamins.
Cafeterian: Here you go, son. Haha.
Mermaid Man: To the table, away!
Barnacle Boy: Careful! Don't run!
SpongeBob: Hey, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: Uh, here comes the TV repairman.
Barnacle Boy: What do you want from us?
SpongeBob: Hold on. Just let me look at ya.
Mermaid Man: Stay alert, Barnacle Boy. He... he's up to something.
Barnacle Boy: Will you cut... will you stop calling me "boy"?
SpongeBob: Do you remember the time the food supply in Atlantis was running low? So you invented a ray gun that makes things grow six times their size to shoot at the kelp gardens. But then the evil Man Ray swoops down and swipes the gun away and shoots all the algae. [jumps onto one of the cafeteria tables where somebody is eating] And he globs onto the undersea dome. [puts his mouth on the table] And he starts sucking on the glass. [an old fish moves his oatmeal away from SpongeBob in disgust]
Barnacle Boy: What's your point, kid?
SpongeBob: You guys are the greatest heroes of all time, and I think you should come out of retirement.
Mermaid Man: Listen up, you villains. I wanna eat my meatloaf. If you don't get out of here, then by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife.
Manager: [enters the cafeteria] What is going on in here?
Mermaid Man: [points to SpongeBob, who stops smiling] You may kiss the bride! [SpongeBob gets kicked out and rolls home]
Patrick: Did you re-unite our heroes?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm married. [Back at the retirement home]
Mermaid Man: [he and Barnacle Boy are in rocking chairs] Up, up, and away. Up, up, and away.
SpongeBob: [dressed up as a woman and speaking in a Southern accent] Oh, mah. This purse is so big and heavy.
Patrick: [dressed up as a robber] Hold it right there, ma'am. I'll be taking that. [grabs SpongeBob's purse]
SpongeBob: [screams] Hay-lp! Hay-lp! Hay-lp!
Patrick: It's working.
SpongeBob: [Barnacle Boy comes over to him] Wha, are you here to rescue little ol' me?
Barnacle Boy: [yells at SpongeBob, ruining his makeup] Pipe down! You could wake Mermaid Man and he's ornery when his nap is disturbed.
SpongeBob: [approaches Mermaid Man, who is sleeping with his eyes open] Ever alert, Mermaid Man has trained himself to sleep with his eyes open.
Barnacle Boy: Confound it, get away from him!
Mermaid Man: [wakes up] Stop shoutin'! I'm nappin'!
Barnacle Boy: [close up to his face] It's not me, you ol' coot!
Retired Elderly #1: Yes.
Retired Elderly #2: That's me.
Retired Elderly #3: I'm over here.
SpongeBob: Excuse me, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: What do you want?
Barnacle Boy: This better be good.
SpongeBob: This'll cheer you up. We're almost done painting your invisible boatmobile. [The invisible boatmobile is shown almost completely covered in black paint and we also see Patrick smiling while holding a paintbrush with black paint on it.]
Barnacle Boy: Gah! It's supposed to be invisible! That's it! We gotta end our life of leisure. It's time to come out of retirement. There's evil afoot.
Mermaid Man: Evil! Where is it?
Barnacle Boy: There it is! [points at SpongeBob and Patrick] You know what this means? [opens up a box with shiny rings]
Mermaid Man: Donuts!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, brother.
[Barnacle Boy puts the ring on Mermaid Man and then they try to put both of the rings together, but they miss. Superhero sequence fails. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy move their arms around up and down to synchronize their positioning of their arms. So then they attempt to unite both of the rings together a second time. Both rings are successfully put together but the superhero sequence fails again.]
Barnacle Boy: Say the oath.
Mermaid Man: [in his young voice] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, unite! [they put the rings together, and this time it works] Throw a waterball at 'em!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Waterballs! Waterballs! [Barnacle Boy throws a waterball at SpongeBob, but nothing happens]
Patrick: Hehehehehe.
Barnacle Boy: Mumbling morays. It's not working, Mermaid Man.
Mermaid Man: He-he's-he's absorbing it like some kind of evil sponge!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Dogpaddle away! [they swim around SpongeBob and Patrick]
Patrick: It's the Raging Whirlpool. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer as the whirlpool consumes them]
Mermaid Man: Those fiends. They're actually enjoying it.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Do it again! Do it again! Do it again!
Barnacle Boy: Now what, Mermaid Man? We need help!
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: Sea creatures, unite! [they summon the sea creatures, but they are retired, so they come slowly]
Barnacle Boy: Hmm, the creatures of the deep seem to have lost some of their luster.
Mermaid Man: Sea creatures, attack!
SpongeBob: Pinch me, I must be dreaming. [sea creatures, now carrying torches and pitchforks, pick up SpongeBob and Patrick] Mission accomplished, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah, we did it. [sea creatures throw them out]
Mermaid Man: I did it. I feel five years younger. Oh, it's good to be back!
Barnacle Boy: We did it, you ol' coot. [they shake hands]
Mermaid Man: Who are you? [Barnacle Boy becomes annoyed]
TV Announcer: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! We join our heroes locked in a battle of wits. [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy play checkers.]
[Mermaid Man places a black checker on the board. A "Pow!" pow-bubble appears. Barnacle Boy replies by placing a red checker on the board. "Clack!" appears. Mermaid Man sweats, then places a black checker to the end of the board. A "King Me!" appears. Suddenly the phone rings.]
Mermaid Man: It's the Aquaphone! [he holds the phone upside down] What is it, Chief? Uhh, hello? Hello? Hello? [Hangs up phone. "HANG UP!" appears] The phone is still broken. Remind me to g-get that fixed. ["SIT!" appears]
Barnacle Boy: Remind you of what?
Mermaid Man: Remind me of what?
TV Announcer: Will our heroes ever get their phone fixed? Tune in next week and find out.
SpongeBob: Wow. That was even better than the old show.
Patrick: All thanks to you. [SpongeBob winks; "WINK!" appears]. 
Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. My name is Squidward. May I take your order?
Clay: Hmmm... uhh... oh, I'll have a... [Squidward takes out a pencil and a paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Maybe... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. [Squidward puts the pencil and the paper away] Hmmm... I'll have... [takes out the pencil and the paper] ...no. Or maybe...
Squidward: Are you planning on ordering today, sir?
Clay: I'll have a Krabby Patty. [Squidward writes down order]
Squidward: How original.
Clay: And with extra onions.
Squidward: Daring today, aren't we? [takes order and shows SpongeBob] One Krabby Patty, extra onions. [SpongeBob takes piece of paper and puts with the rest of the orders]
SpongeBob: One cryin' Johnny comin' up! First bun, then patty, followed by ketchup, mustard, pickles, extra onions, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, and bun, in that order. One cryin' Johnny! Up! [bell rings]
Squidward: Whatever. [John comes up and tells Squidward what he wants and Squidward relays order to SpongeBob] Twelve Krabby Patties on wheat buns! [SpongeBob takes a plate and patties begin to appear on the plate]
SpongeBob: [at rapid speed] Bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun, bun, patty, ketchup, tomato, bun. One dozen cryin' cows on the farm! Up! [Squidward takes the plate]
Squidward: Thanks, Farmer Brown. [gives the plate to John] It's been a thrill serving you.
John: Can I get some extra salt?
Squidward: We're all out.
John: Could you check?
Squidward: No. [John glares at Squidward as he leaves. Bubble Bass walks up to order] Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
Bubble Bass: I'll take a Double Triple Bossy Deluxe on a raft, four by four, animal-style, extra shingles with a shimmy and a squeeze, light axle grease, make it cry, burn it, and let it swim. [Squidward gives up writing all of that down]
Squidward: We serve food here, sir. [SpongeBob shows Squidward he has already gotten the order done]
SpongeBob: I got it already, Squidward. [gasps] Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: [pushes Squidward away] SquarePants. [walks to SpongeBob] I hear talk you make a mean Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [staring at Bubble Bass] Yep. I hear talk you're kinda picky.
Bubble Bass: Yep.
SpongeBob: Well then... here ya go! [Bubble Bass takes the plate and sits down where he examines the Krabby Patty until he decides to take a bite] Well, Bubble Bass, whaddaya think?
Bubble Bass: This is pretty good. Only one thing. You forgot the pickles! [shows no pickles on the patty]
Crowd: [gasp]
SpongeBob: No!
Bubble Bass: The best there is? I don't think so. You lose! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [checks patty for pickles] But, the pickles should be right where they always are. I know I put them on! [customers are disappointed; tears the patty apart, finding the pickles] Where are those pickles? Pickles? Pickles? Pickles? [Bubble Bass walks up to Mr. Krabs, but also throws Squidward out of the way again]
Bubble Bass: I believe you owe me two bucks.
Mr. Krabs: Two bucks?!
Bubble Bass: Your guarantee. [points to the menu where in tiny print it says 'money-back guarantee']
Mr. Krabs: Oh. That. Well, can't we talk about this? [takes out two dollars and Bubble Bass grabs it]
Bubble Bass: No.
Mr. Krabs: [pulls money back] How about a discount on restroom tokens? [Bubble Bass takes money back]
Bubble Bass: Afraid not.
Mr. Krabs: How's about a free glass of water? A dozen free glasses of water! I'll even put ice in it! [Bubble Bass walks out the Krusty Krab with the money] No! Come back! Two dollars! Two dollars, no! No! [walks over to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I know I put pickles on that Krabby Patty.
Mr. Krabs: [grabs SpongeBob] That two bucks is comin' out of your paycheck! [SpongeBob tries to hang onto the floor]
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! Wait! [Mr. Krabs throws SpongeBob into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Get back to work, we got orders waitin'!
Squidward: I need a Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: Okay, I am not gonna blow it this time. Let's see. Bun down. Then ketchup, then mustard, then pickles? No! That's not right! [starts a new patty] Bun down. Mustard, then ketchup, lettuce, then the pickles? No! [tries again] Mustard down, bun stuff down, d'oh, where's the patty go? [tries again and uses the same bun] Pickles, ketchup, wait! Think! Think! I'm losin' it! [tries again] Bun down, shoe, mustard, pan, bun... no! [Mr. Krabs comes in] Mr. Krabs, I am so confused. I can't remember how to do anything.
Mr. Krabs: Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
SpongeBob: Oh, no, Mr. Krabs. Who will make the Krabby Patties?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, don't worry about that. We've got Squidward!
Squidward: Huh? [SpongeBob walks out and goes home]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs is right. I need to get my head straight. Now is it bun, patty, ketchup... [looks up and notices door is not there] The door! The door! Mr. Krabs, the front door is missing! [Mr. Krabs opens door a couple feet away] Oh. [laughs] Sorry about that, Mr. Krabs. This pickle thing has got my head all messed up. I better go on home and rest my brain. [walks out] Uhh, which way do I live? [Mr. Krabs points the path] Of course. [laughs. Later, we see SpongeBob in his house trying to write down the formula] No, no! Was it bun, patty, bun... Let's see, tomatoes, pickles, bun? No. Bun? No. Bun? No. Shoe? [throws paper and pencil away] I am so confused! Maybe a good night's sleep will help me get my head on straight. [at night]
SpongeBob: Oh... was it mattress, mattress, sheets, pillow, then SpongeBob? Or... [hits his head with his fist] D'oh... think, Sponge! Oh yeah! It was mattress, SpongeBob, mattress, then sheets, pillow. [gets in between the two mattresses] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Aw, this isn't right. [he slips out and stands upside-down on his bed] Good night, Gary.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Wait, this isn't right either. [SpongeBob lays down on his back] Nope. [SpongeBob is between each railing of the ladder] Nuh-uh. [tries sleeping with a mattress on his head] Negative. [tries sleeping on the ground next to his mattresses] C'mon, c'mon! Get it right. [tries in the lifesaver] Wrong. Wrong! Wrong! Nope! Naw! Negatory! Nyet! [keeps doing the wrong things as the clock fast-forwards to morning where the alarm goes off. SpongeBob is under all three mattresses on the floor] Aww, I almost had it! Alarm clock. D'oh, how do I turn this thing off? Think, think, think, think!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Gary! [picks up Gary and shoves him in the foghorn alarm where it is still going off. At The Krusty Krab]
Squidward: [there is black smoke coming from kitchen. Squidward clears the smoke off with a fire extinguisher] Patties are done. [Mr. Krabs notices black, burnt patties and gets irritated]
Mr. Krabs: Urrgh! [Turns backwards from the counter after hearing customers starting to complain]
Unknown Anchovy: Hey, he burnt my Krabby Patty.
Martha: He burnt my fries!
Billy: [Briefly drinks his burnt shake until realizing it is burnt.] He burnt my shake.
All customers: [all yelling and mumbling]
Mr. Krabs: No! Come back! No! No! Urrgh... I gotta get SpongeBob back!
[cuts to SpongeBob's house, he nailed a toaster to the door]
Mr. Krabs: [opens door] SpongeBob?
[music playing in reverse; the house is a total disaster as everything is misplaced and things are everywhere and opposite]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [now he has underwear on his head] Mr. Krabs, hello. Do you how do?
Mr. Krabs: Why you talkin' funny, lad? [takes the underwear off SpongeBob's head]
SpongeBob: I anything can't do right since because pickles.
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, you'll be back makin' Krabby Patties like your old self in no time!
SpongeBob: I think don't ready back to go to work, Mr. Krabs. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: But you're fine, me boy! [SpongeBob walks right through the wooden kitchen door] Ohh... uhh, well... maybe not. [walks into the kitchen where SpongeBob is nailing a piece of bread to the table] All we need to do is get your confidence back. So, you can make me more money! I-I-I mean, patties. [chuckles]
SpongeBob: I how do that?
Mr. Krabs: It's like riding a bike. You never forget! [notices a bike in a boiling pot of water on the stove] Uhh... I'm gonna help ya! [shown both of them sitting on the ground in SpongeBob's living room] If you learn to make a Krabby Patty again, your life will be back in order. [takes out a blanket with all the ingredients on it]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, I don't know if I...
Mr. Krabs: Take your time. [SpongeBob thinks of the Krabby Patty formula. It soon turns to night then day again. SpongeBob reaches for a bun and Mr. Krabs gets excited. SpongeBob puts bun back down]
SpongeBob: No, no, no, no, no. [Day becomes night again. Then day again and then night again. Mr. Krabs is sleeping until SpongeBob wakes him up] I got it! I got it! It's all very clear to me now, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: It is?
SpongeBob: Yes! I finally realize that I can't do it! I can't do it, Mr. Krabs! I'm a failure!
Mr. Krabs: Don't talk like that!
SpongeBob: Don't you get it, you crustaceous cheapskate? I can't make a Double Krabby Patty with the works! [Makes patty as he tells Mr. Krabs the ingredients] I can't put a patty on a bun, with lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, pickles, and top bun together in that order! [notices the Krabby Patty he just made, was in the correct order]
Mr. Krabs: It's time.
[Mr. Krabs and SpongeBob walk back to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob rescued Squidward from the burning kitchen and extinguishes him, too.]
Unnamed fish: Hey, SpongeBob's back! [men and women are cheering]
Bubble Bass: I hear SquarePants is back! [SpongeBob opens the kitchen door]
SpongeBob: I'm right here, Bubble Bass.
Bubble Bass: I thought I ran you out of town. [spits a loogie into a bucket]
SpongeBob: This is where I belong! [holds up bubbles and blows one] .
Bubble Bass: [Gives a weird sounding roar]
SpongeBob: Rawr.
[The crowd gasps. SpongeBob and Bubble Bass glare at each other, while Mr. Krabs is sweating with anticipation]
Bubble Bass: Give me the regular. And this time, don't forget the pickles.
SpongeBob: [rushes into the kitchen and comes back with a Krabby Patty in the blink of an eye] I didn't.
[Mr. Krabs is violently sweating as Bubble Bass examines and eats the patty]
Bubble Bass: Hmm... ...Still no pickles! [SpongeBob notices] See? [sticks out his tongue with all the chewed up food on it. Everyone is getting sick at the sight of it and they’re disgusted] You failed again, SpongeBob "Loser"Pants! [laughs]
SpongeBob: Wait a minute! [grabs Bubble Bass' tongue and pulls it out] Look! [shows four pickles under Bubble Bass' tongue] He's been hiding the pickles under his tongue the whole time!
Mr. Krabs: And there's the pickles from last time, too!
Shubie: And there's my car keys! [everyone walks up to Bubble Bass, all glaring at him]
Bubble Bass: And... there's my ride! [runs out the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Three cheers for the return of our master fry cook, SpongeBob! Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Hooray.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Whoop-de-doo.
Mr. Krabs: Hip hip...
All: Hooray!
Squidward: Oh, boy.
SpongeBob: And three cheers for the fry cook who took my place when I was gone: Squidward! [Squidward smiles] Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Squidward is shocked and frowns. The frown becomes more droopier with each "Boo"]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo! [Scene changes to outside of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
All: Boo!
SpongeBob: Hip hip...
Customer: Boo! You stink!
Narrator: Mrs. Puff's Boating School. Where diligent students learn the rules of the road.
Mrs. Puff: Everyone, put down your books, because it's time to pick out the hall monitor of the day! [SpongeBob squeezes his pencil so hard it shoots up into the air] Let's see here. This weeks hall monitor will be Bart, Jimmy, no, no, Tina, Ralph, mm... [gasps] [shaking nervously]...SpongeBob...! [SpongeBob moves his desk between two rows] It's Jimmy! Jimmy's the hall monitor.
Jimmy: Mrs. Puff, I've done it already! [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Ohh... Phil?
Phil: No way, Mrs. Puff. [SpongeBob moves his desk closer]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh, Tina, you're the hall monitor.
Tina: Hey, I've done it three times already! [SpongeBob moves up closer]
Mrs. Puff: B...uh...B-Beth!
Student: She graduated!
Mrs. Puff: Henry?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Vera?! [SpongeBob moves closer] Clayton?! [SpongeBob is poking Mrs. Puff with his desk as she sighs] Alright, I guess I have no choice. [gulps] The hall monitor of the day is [she sighs] SpongeBob. [SpongeBob launches into the air]
SpongeBob: Yahoo! Hall monitor SpongeBob reporting for duty, ma'am! I am ready to assume my position... in the hall! I will protect all that are weak... in the hall! All rules will be enforced... in the hall!
Mrs. Puff: Okay! Just take the hat and belt. [tries handing him uniform]
SpongeBob: I can't accept that yet, ma'am. First, I have to make my speech.
Mrs. Puff: You can't make this easy, can you?
SpongeBob: Classmates! Who am I to deserve such a great honor? Why, I would be nothing without Mrs. Puff.
Mrs. Puff: Give me a break.
SpongeBob: And to my public, all I can say is I'm touched. And furthermore, I will carry out my duties... [clock moves forward in time as SpongeBob continues his speech] ...crime and punishment, punishment and crime in the hall! [at this point almost everyone, is asleep] Which reminds me of an extremely long speech written by the greatest hall monitor of all time. [takes out a long roll of paper] "Friends, students, juvenile delinquents, lend me your ears." [the clock has disappeared, and it is now much later in the day. Puff is asleep at her desk] In conclusion, and without a moment to spare, I will put on this uniform [takes out the hat and belt] and assume my duties as... [puts on the uniform] ...hall monitor! Wish me luck, Mrs. Puff! [walks towards the door then turns around] Oh, and I will be re... [bell rings as all students run over SpongeBob]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob, are you okay?
SpongeBob: I overdid the speech again, didn't I?
Mrs. Puff: I'm afraid so.
SpongeBob: Aww, tartar sauce. I guess I won't be needing this. [takes off his uniform] I hardly knew ya. [gives uniform to Mrs. Puff and walks away saddened]
Mrs. Puff: Uhh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I can at least let you wear it until tomorrow.
SpongeBob: A-hoo! [dives into the uniform] Thanks, Mrs. Puff!
Mrs. Puff: What are the consequences of what I've just done? [cut to SpongeBob walking down the street, singing somewhat incomprehensibly. Then notices a broken traffic light]
SpongeBob: Broken traffic light! Who's to say my monitor duties should end just because the bell rang? I can be helpful anywhere! This looks like a job for the hall monitor! [directs traffic, with a whistle, to their destination using all sorts of hand gestures, but ends up causing a huge wreck in the end] What would this town do without you, SpongeBob?
Fred: My leg! My leg!
SpongeBob: On patrol. I'm on patrol. [notices a house with an open window] Uh-oh, an open window. [peeks through the window and there is a couple eating]
Vera: More seaweed medley, dear?
SpongeBob: The fools. They've left themselves susceptible to danger. I must show them the error of their ways through example. [jumps through the window and onto their table in a ski mask, screaming as he does so] I'm the open window maniac! [both run out screaming] I hope you learned a valuable lesson! [shuts the window and begins walking again] On patrol. I'm on patrol. I'm on patrol... [gasps as he sees a puddle of pink goo on the ground] Vandals! Another crime. [takes his finger and tastes the pink goo] hmm...strawberry! I must act! [more pink goo falls on his head. He looks up and sees Patrick eating some strawberry ice cream] Patrick... [looks around for the voice he just heard] Patrick... Patrick...
Patrick: My ice cream! It's alive! [screams and throws away the ice cream]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Down here!
Patrick: Oh, SpongeBob, it's you. [ice cream cone is on SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Patrick. Come down here. [Patrick jumps down on top of SpongeBob]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I'm down here.
Patrick: Hehe, you look funny! Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: That's hall monitor to you!
Patrick: Sorry, officer.
SpongeBob: Sorry's not good enough, Patrick. You've committed a crime, and I'm taking you in.
Patrick: What crime? [shows him the ice cream that is on the ground] I'm a bad person! [cries]
Newspaper Boy: [High Voice] Extra! Extra! "Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!" City paralyzed with fear! [gives one to SpongeBob] [Gruff Voice] Take it, friends. Arm yourselves with knowledge. [runs off] [High voice again] Extra! Extra! Maniac strikes Bikini Bottom!
SpongeBob: [reads paper] "Maniac. Bikini Bottom? Car wrecks? Break-in?". Who better to bring this maniac to justice than me, the hall monitor! But I can't handle this case alone. Patrick, are you ready to give up your life of crime?
Patrick: [still crying] I wanna be good!
SpongeBob: Hmmm... now you just need a symbol of authority. [Patrick puts the ice cream cone on his head] Perfect! It is our duty to catch this maniac and bring him to justice! But how to proceed? Listen, deputy, you're an ex-criminal. What would you do?
Patrick: Hmmm... I'd get an ice cream! [both walk out an ice cream store with ice cream]
SpongeBob: Okay, now what?
Patrick: Hmmm... [both come out the ice cream store again with ice cream]
SpongeBob: This isn't working. We've got to do something else. Something with walkie-talkies! [takes out two walkie-talkies. Patrick grabs one and is elated with joy] And now, duty calls! Alright, deputy, I'll go that way, you go some different way! Run ‘em out! [SpongeBob runs off sounding like a siren. The police come driving up and stop beside Patrick]
Officer Rob: Afternoon, son.
Patrick: Hello, brothers. [salutes to the officers, then raises both eyebrows whilst pointing to his cone hat]
Officer Rob: Son, we're looking for the maniac.
Officer John: Have you seen THIS MAN?! [He whips out a poster that says WANTED MANIAC with SpongeBob's picture on it.]
Patrick: [screams] It's the maniac! Take him away, take him away!
Officer Rob: Calm down, son. It's just a drawing, not the real thing. Now we're gonna show you this picture again, and you tell us if you've seen this guy. Understand?
Patrick: Yeah, uh-huh.
Officer Rob: Okay. [Officer John shows Patrick the poster again]
Patrick: [screams] Horrible!
[Officer John removes the poster, bemused. He holds up the poster again. Patrick screams again. Both cops then look at each other and smile slyly. Officer John repeatedly shows and takes away the poster as Patrick screams every single time. Eventually, the cops decide they've had enough fun.]
Officer Rob: Stay indoors, son.
Officer John: And, uhh, take that cone off your head. [both laugh as they drive off]
Patrick: [takes out walkie-talkie] SpongeBob? Come in, SpongeBob. Answer!
SpongeBob: SpongeBob here, Patrick. Report.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] I don't wanna be a policeman anymore. I'm scared!
SpongeBob: Get a hold of yourself, deputy.
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie, sobbing] I wanna go home!
SpongeBob: Poor rookie. Alright, I'm on my way back.
Patrick: Hurry, SpongeBob, I think it's getting... [the bright sky suddenly, becomes dark] ...dark.
SpongeBob: Just put on your siren and I'll be right there.
Patrick: Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. Wee-woo. [Patrick picks up the poster that the officers showed him earlier. Then sees a darkish figure down the road. It's SpongeBob, but Patrick doesn't realize it] [gasps loudly] Wee-woo! Wee-woo! Wee-woo! SpongeBob! I see him!
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Where is he, Patrick?
Patrick: [over walkie-talkie] At the intersection of Conch and Coral. [SpongeBob turns his head around to read the street sign]
SpongeBob: That's where I am! He's right on top of me, but I can't see him! What's he doing?
Patrick: Uhh, he's just standing there... MENACINGLY! [screams over walkie-talkie] GET OUT OF THERE, SPONGEBOB! [SpongeBob screams] THAT'S HIS MANIAC SHRIEK! HE'S GOING TO ATTACK! [SpongeBob cries while running around in circles] He's acting all crazy! RUN! HIDE BEHIND THAT BUILDING! [SpongeBob hides behind the building] NO, HE'S BEHIND THAT BUILDING! OH, QUICK, HIDE BEHIND THAT STREET SIGN! [SpongeBob hides behind the street sign] NO WAIT! THE MANIAC JUST WENT BEHIND THAT SIGN! QUICK! GET UNDER THE STREET LIGHT! [SpongeBob gets under the street lights] NO WAIT, AGH, HE'S THERE, TOO! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! [SpongeBob jumps inside a mailbox. As he tries to relax, the radio is cutting out]
SpongeBob: [over walkie-talkie] Say again, deputy?
Patrick: THE MANIAC'S IN THE MAILBOX! [SpongeBob screams and bursts his arms and legs through the mailbox. He alternates between screaming and crazily jabbering as he runs through three buildings, causing them to topple over and eventually crashes through a fence plasted with wanted posters]
SpongeBob: [takes a look at a wanted poster] Huh, this guy's not half-bad-looking for a maniac. Wait a minute, Patrick, I'm the maniac! [Patrick screams in the background and a mass of police cars surround SpongeBob]
Officer Durado: We'll take that as a confession. [Mrs. Puff appears]
Mrs. Puff: SpongeBob SquarePants, there you are! I turn my back on you for one minute and you destroy half the city! You should be ashamed of yourself! [SpongeBob slumps sadly at these words]
Officer #1: You know this guy?
Mrs. Puff: Of course I do. I'm the one who gave him the uniform in the first place. He's my responsibility. [the cops glare at her] Uh-oh... [at the boating school where the whole class, except SpongeBob, is sleeping. Mrs. Puff is teaching class from jail through the TV] And in conclusion, students: red means stop, green means go. And SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: [frowns nervously] Yes, Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: I'd like to see you after class. Six months from now! [jail closure sound] 
Narrator: Ah, Jellyfish Fields. Here we find SpongeBob once again stalking the wild jellyfish. SpongeBob? Hello? SpongeBob? Hmmm... he's supposed to be here somewhere... [narrator sees a square-shaped coral] A-ha! [Jellyfish floats by. SpongeBob puts his glasses on]
SpongeBob: Safety first. [SpongeBob captures a jellyfish] A-ha! I finally gotcha! [SpongeBob grabs a wooden stool and sits on it. Puts on a farmer hat and 'milks' the jellyfish. Jelly comes out and squirts on a piece of bread. The jellyfish moos like a cow. He eats.] Ah, there is nothing better than the taste of natural jelly from a jellyfish. See you later! [walks off but jellyfish floats towards him with his glasses] Oh, oh my glasses! Thanks, little guy! Bye! [the jellyfish floats with SpongeBob] I can't play anymore, jellyfish. I got to get home. [jellyfish hangs onto SpongeBob's nose] No. You can't go home with me. [jellyfish walks behind him. The jellyfish's steps are squeaking, like SpongeBob's] Jellyfish, you've got to stay here! Hey! [puts the jellyfish on a rock] Stay! [walks backwards] Stay... [jellyfish floats around SpongeBob. SpongeBob grabs the jellyfish and uses a slingshot to launch him somewhere else but the jellyfish ends up on his back. The jellyfish giggles. SpongeBob pulls the jellyfish off] [exasperated] Jellyfish! For the last time, you cannot come home with me! [SpongeBob looks at the jellyfish sternly. The jellyfish deflates as if he was sad. SpongeBob decides to keep him] Ahh, what the heck! [SpongeBob, with the jellyfish on a rope, like a dog, walk by Squidward's house] Squidward! Hey, Squidward! Squidward! Squidwardiard! [Squidward peeks out his window] Squidward! Look at my new pet!
Squidward: That's no pet, that's a wild animal.
SpongeBob: No he isn't! Watch this! Fetch! [throws a stick so the jellyfish returns it. SpongeBob is holding up three fingers] How many fingers am I holding up? [the jellyfish hums deeply three times] Play dead! [jellyfish is buried underground with a tomb that says "R.I.P.". He pops up]
Squidward: I wouldn't let that thing into my house even if it was potty-trained! [the jellyfish, still on the rope, is on a toilet reading a newspaper as he hums casually] I didn't need to see that.
SpongeBob: Well, we're going to my house to have a little fun.
Squidward: How can you possibly have fun with a jellyfish? [SpongeBob and the jellyfish dance to some music. Also, various colors change as they dance. Disco lights rotate around the room. SpongeBob's house is vibrating from the music] SpongeBob is the only guy I know who can have fun with a jellyfish... for twelve hours!
SpongeBob: [stops dancing. He is exhausted, sees the jellyfish dance more] Whew! Wow, you sure like to dance. Well, that's enough for tonight. It's time to go to bed. [as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on] Huh? [walks over to turn the music off] You got it all wrong, little fella. [as he walks off, the jellyfish turns the music back on. SpongeBob turns it back off] Bed. Repeat after me. [SpongeBob ties the rope around the jellyfish] Bed! [upstairs, SpongeBob ties the rope around his bedpost] We'll just keep you right here.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Quit worrying, Gary. He'll be just fine. Good night, everybody. [as he is sleeping throughout the night, other jellyfish float inside the pineapple]
Gary: Meow. [jellyfish opens the window, and the 4 jellyfish talking in jellyfish speaking] Meow. [gets squirted with jelly from all the jellyfish, they laugh at Gary, and continue squirting jelly on him] Meow. [More jellyfish enter SpongeBob's House. It's now daytime]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Gary. Good morning, jellyfish. Jellyfish? Jellyfish? Here, jellyfish. Oh, jelly! [puts on his green robe and goes to check downstairs]
Gary: [Follows SpongeBob to the doorway] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, jellyfi-! [slips on some jelly. Opens a door leading into his living room and sees jellyfish dancing to music. The jellyfish are having a dance party.] Where'd you all come from? [jellyfish form a figure of a hand and the hand grabs SpongeBob. They stick over a light bulb like a disco ball and spin him. Then falls to the ground] Okay, that's it. Party is over! You guys have overstayed your welcome. [As SpongeBob is walking to the stereo, jellyfish form a flight of stairs that SpongeBob walks up and falls off of] This music is way too loud. [jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a triangle] Very funny. [jellyfish carry SpongeBob in a rectangle] I'm serious! [Jellyfish carry SpongeBob up and down the screen. The scene then goes to SpongeBob's house bouncing up and down because of the loud party. Squidward's house. Squidward is still lying in his bed, holding a pillow against his face. He has not slept all night.]
Squidward: Grr! Eighteen hours! [falls off his bed, picks up the phone and dials SpongeBob's number] I'm gonna give that SpongeBob a piece of my mind!
Jellyfish: [Cut back to the party. Jellyfish picks up the phone. ] [garbled] Hello?
Squidward: SpongeBob, listen to me, you square-headed assault on my ears! I've had enough of this! [Jelly squirts through the phone and onto Squidward's face] Strawberry. [Squidward plays his clarinet outside his window] Two can play at this! [plays his clarinet badly. Jellyfish form a smiley face.]
SpongeBob: Come on, guys, enough is enough! [SpongeBob hears the clarinet music in the distance.] Huh? [Cuts back to the Jellyfish's smile, but this time, turns into an angry frown when Squidward plays his clarinet] Uh-oh![Jellyfish sting SpongeBob] Hey, take it easy! Ow! Okay, I'll talk to him! [SpongeBob peeks his head out his window] Squidward! Would it be possible to play your clarinet a little... better? I don't think the jellyfish like it.
Squidward: The jellyfish don't like...? [sarcastically] Why, sure, pal, I can play better.
SpongeBob: Okay, he said he'll play better. [Squidward's house rotates slowly towards SpongeBob's house. He has a giant amp set behind him. In front of him is a microphone. Squidward inhales deeply as his house stretches, then he plays his clarinet extremely loudly.] Uh-oh! That's not better! [Jellyfish knocks SpongeBob's coral plant over] Hey! Take it easy with that! [The jellyfish knock over his television] Those are my things! [The jellyfish knock over a wall decoration] Don't break th- Dow! [The jellyfish float out of the party and into Squidward's house]
Squidward: Uhh, w-wait, I can turn it down. Ow! Ow! Ow! [the jellyfish sting Squidward and float back into SpongeBob's house, returning to their party. A welt-covered Squidward walks up to the door and gives SpongeBob his clarinet] Everybody's a critic. You won't be hearing from me anymore.
SpongeBob: Hey, now, that wasn't nice! [jellyfish take the clarinet and snap it in half. A fire forms and they dance around it in a circle. Boat horn toots as SpongeBob finally reaches his breaking point.] Okay, that is it! Everybody out! [He grabs the stereo and runs toward the door but the jellyfish try to take it back so they can party more. Both sides accidentally let go and the stereo falls to floor and shatters into pieces with a crash causing the music to stop. SpongeBob gulps and the jellyfish start to quiver, due to the loss of the music, thus ending their party. SpongeBob stammers. The jellyfish get angry and sting SpongeBob] Come on, Gary! [SpongeBob and Gary head up to the roof. SpongeBob's house vibrates forcefully, and the jellyfish start to swarm around the house.] Gary, you were right. Thanks for not rubbing it in. [SpongeBob looks scared and his teeth chatter. Gary clicks his eyes together making a beat that the jellyfish can dance to] Huh? They stopped? [holds Gary's eyes together and the jellyfish get angry again. Then he lets go of Gary's eyes and they dance again. Does this a couple more times and notices a trend] Gary! Don't... stop... shaking it! [takes Gary to Jellyfish Fields. Along the way, SpongeBob has other creatures and things join in the rhythm. Eventually, he gets the jellyfish back home to Jellyfish Fields and he runs back to his home]
Narrator: Today, SpongeBob has learned one of the sea's harshest lessons: wild animals can throw very wild parties. [SpongeBob shakes Gary's eye, congratulating him. Squidward sinks down into his bubble bath as he groans in pain] Ooh, I felt that.
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy. Hey, Sandy! [While knocking on her door, a spaceship comes up from underneath the ground at the left side of the tree dome] Wow! [Sandy peeks her head out of a spaceship window]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob, how do you like it?
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: It's a rocket ship, duh! I'll meet you downstairs and show you around.
SpongeBob: [Sandy rides an elevator on the bottom floor and meets SpongeBob downstairs] Wow, what are you gonna do with it?
Sandy: [pointing to a poster of the moon] I'm going to the moon, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: The moon! Can I go?
Sandy: No way, SpongeBob. Especially after your little mishap with my whirlybird. [shown a graveyard of dead animals] Besides, there's not enough room for you.
SpongeBob: But I don't take up that much space! [squishes himself into a little square] See? [downsizes himself to fit into a little drawer] I can fit in here. [closes the drawer] Mmm, cozy.
Sandy: I need that drawer.
SpongeBob: Well, how about... [jumps into a test tube] This? [jumps into another test tube] Or this? [jumps into another test tube] Or this?
Sandy: SpongeBob, this isn't for fun. [shows her clipboard with math equations on it] See this? This is science. I don't have time for games and I don't have time for stowaways. [SpongeBob is behind a set of bars]
SpongeBob: Fine. [deep voice] Put me in the brig, I don't mind!
Sandy: That's the air vent, SpongeBob. [pushes a button to turn the air vent on that blows SpongeBob out of it] I need that, too.
SpongeBob: Oh, please, can I go? Can I? Can I? Huh? Please?
Sandy: All right. Y'all can ride in the cargo hold if you just...
SpongeBob: [running around the ship] Yeah! Goin' to the moon! Moon ride, moon ride, moon ride!
Sandy: [grabs SpongeBob] But this time, just don't touch anything, okay? [Cuts to Sandy pumping a gun and SpongeBob comes to watch her]
SpongeBob: Wow, look at that pop gun. Are we gonna go hunting aliens on the moon?
Sandy: Aww, hush, silly. [shoots her gun and 3 gray nets cover a couple items] This is for harvesting moon rocks.
SpongeBob: Well, when you're done playing with rocks, you could use that for some serious alien hunting.
Sandy: Aliens? Are you nuts? I've been to the moon, there are no aliens.
SpongeBob: Sandy, Sandy, Sandy. How could you be so naïve? There's evidence all around us. How do you explain Atlantis, cow licks, 99¢ stores? [walks around and forms a circle around him and Sandy with his shoes] And how about those mysterious circles that pop up in kelp fields over night? [sees a circle] Ah! There's one now!
Sandy: SpongeBob, you don't know the first thing about outer space. Now go home and get some shut eye. Be here tomorrow at the crack of dawn and leave your crazy alien notions behind.
SpongeBob: [trying to sleep. Checks the clock every few seconds] Oh, hurry up! [grabs two clothes pins and puts them on his eyelids] These oughta do the trick.
Patrick: [Sitting in the window] Hi ya, SpongeBob! [clothes pins shoot off his eyes]
SpongeBob: What is it, Patrick? Can't you see I'm sleeping here?
Patrick: Well, I know you're going on that moon trip tomorrow, so I just wanted to bring you something.
SpongeBob: A present?
Patrick: No. Uh, SpongeBob, is Sandy's rocket alien proof?
SpongeBob: There are no aliens, Patrick. Just ask Sandy.
Patrick: [shows a spray can] Well, I guess you won't be needing this alien repellent for your trip!
SpongeBob: Alien repellent? Let me see that. [looks at the can] New Alien-Out Window Protectant. Does not stop burglars. Well, I guess you're right, Patrick. We'd better go spray those windows! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to the rocket]
Patrick: Look how big it is, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: It's pretty impressive, all right.
Patrick: Come on! [both head for the rocket]
SpongeBob: We're just here to spray the windows, Patrick!
Patrick: Wow. How do you think we get inside? [pulls a level that says "open"]
SpongeBob: We don't, we're just spraying the... [door opens on SpongeBob] ...windows.
Patrick: I opened it, SpongeBob! Come on! [both walk inside] Holy sea cow, SpongeBob. This must be the control room.
SpongeBob: Yeah, just don't touch anything. [Patrick starts playing with everything]
Patrick: Look, I'm winning!
SpongeBob: Patrick, cut that out! Patrick, come on, we can't hang around in here. This is Sandy's big rocket, not some kind of a fun... [SpongeBob turns around and looks at himself as thin in the mirror] ...house?
Patrick: Woo-hoo! Winner! Yeah! High score!
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick, what game was that, anyway?
Patrick: I don't know! [notices a lever above his head] But let's see what this does!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I don't think we should... [Patrick pulls a lever and the two launch off the seat out of the rocket]
Patrick: I like rockets. [both fall back into the rocket]
Patrick: More! More!
SpongeBob: No more! [Patrick presses a button and both shake a lot then stop] Okay, one more. [shake again] Okay, that's enough. Let's go.
Patrick: Oh, wait, I think this one starts it. [SpongeBob stops Patrick from pushing a button]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing? I'm the space traveler here and I happen to know that that particular button is right over here. [presses the engine button and the ship starts up and is blasting off]
Patrick: We've started the rocket!
Sandy: [notices the smoke] Oh, SpongeBob... [SpongeBob and Patrick hold onto each other while the ship is taking off]
Patrick: Hold on, buddy! [while screaming, SpongeBob and Patrick are falling down to the bottom of the ship. The ship enters space and both of them start to float] Hey, we stopped falling!
SpongeBob: Look! [points at the dark galaxy] We're in space now! Wee! [both float around in the ship]
Patrick: Hey! Whoa! Somebody get me down, or up, or something! [SpongeBob laughs as the ship is going around the moon] Hey, SpongeBob, watch this! [squirts toothpaste into some peanut butter]
SpongeBob: Hey! You got your toothpaste in my peanut butter! [SpongeBob lifts a heavy weight on one finger] Patrick, I can do this! [the ship is landing back into the sea and the heavy weight hurls into the ground and flattens SpongeBob's hand]
Patrick: Hey, who turned the heavy back on?
SpongeBob: We must be landing.
Patrick: All right! [Sandy uses her jetpack to fly up to the moon]
Sandy: Sometimes that SpongeBob is as dumb as a sack of peanuts. [the ship is now in Bikini Bottom. While Sandy searches for SpongeBob and Patrick on the moon, these two get out of the ship]
Patrick: Wow, it sure looks a lot like home. [Patrick sees Gary asleep] Hey, look, it's Gary! Come here, Gary. Gary!
SpongeBob: Wait, don't go near it, Patrick! Can't you see this is all a trick? The aliens are projecting our memories onto the environment! They're trying to confuse us, Patrick.
Patrick: So you mean to say they've taken what we thought we think and make us think we thought our thoughts we've been thinking our thoughts we think we thought? I think...
SpongeBob: Okay, but I'm not gonna to fall for it! [SpongeBob captures Gary with a gray net-like substance] Yeah!
Patrick: You got him, SpongeBob! Won't Sandy be proud.
SpongeBob: Sandy. I forgot about her. She's gonna hate us for stealing her rocket. But won't she feel silly when I bring home a real live alien? Aww, she'll love me! [grabs Gary] Come on, Patrick, the more, the merrier! [tosses Gary into the ship. Ship's number increases from 00 to 01; ding from "The Price Is Right"]
Patrick: Alien hunting! Alien hunting!
SpongeBob: Shh, quiet, Patrick, don't let them know we're onto them! Uh, yeah, alien hunting. I saw that on TV, too. Gee, Patrick, let's drop in on our old pal Squidward and see what he's up to. [whispering to Patrick] Make sure your gun is pumped. [go in and see Squidward sleeping] Look at it, Patrick, it's disgusting. [Squidward moves his arms and legs around then puts them back down. He mutters in his sleep and all we can understand is the word "Grandma"] It's even uglier up close. Let's begin the analysis. [SpongeBob takes the covers off. Squidward is wearing a pink floral top]
Patrick: Wait, what's that? [SpongeBob takes a red bag out from underneath Squidward. It appears to be a hot water bottle] I think I'm gonna be sick.
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you know what this thing is?
Patrick: Stinky.
SpongeBob: No, it's an egg sack! Let's look at the embryo. [Patrick puts flashlight under the so-called "egg sack" and SpongeBob's hands are under it]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Twins. [Squidward rolls over in his sleep and his right tentacle sticks on Patrick's helmet]
Patrick: Pardon my French, but get this thing off me! [SpongeBob and Patrick try to get his tentacles off but they wake him up instead]
Squidward: Patrick and SpongeBob? Get out of my bedroom! And give me back my tentacles!
Patrick: It's awake!
SpongeBob: Let's capture the little phony! [Squidward screams]
Squidward: Get away from me! [runs away while SpongeBob and Patrick try to capture him. Outside, Mr. Krabs walks up with his pet worm and notices Squidward's house shaking. SpongeBob and Patrick come out with Squidward captured]
Mr. Krabs: Ahoy, there, lads! Up a bit late to be playing pirate, aren't ye? [laughs. SpongeBob and Patrick point their guns at his head] Wait! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, shoot me, but don't take me money!
SpongeBob: We don't want your money, moon man! [both capture Mr. Krabs and toss him and Squidward into the ship] Look at them squirming around in there.
Patrick: Eww, gross.
SpongeBob: Well, there's plenty more where those came from. [at Boating School]
Mrs. Puff: [grading some of her students' paper] SpongeBob, what are you doing here so late? [captured] Whatever this is... [inflates herself and has a deep voice] ...it's going on your permanent record! [Flats, a woman, and Larry are captured along with all of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob and Patrick are run out of room in the ship for everyone]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I think we might have to make a second trip.
SpongeBob: There's no time for that! Just push harder. [Sandy is on her jetpack floating down]
Sandy: SpongeBob, what are y'all doing? I can't turn my back on you for two seconds without you causing a whole mess of trouble. Why look at ya, bagging up all your friends and neighbors just like they were a fresh crop of hickory smoked sausages. You darned turned my little science experiment into a disaster. You two oughta should be ashamed of... [SpongeBob and Patrick capture her]
SpongeBob: Nice try, Sandy.
Patrick: Or should I say Ms. Alien Pants. [laughs]
Sandy: Aliens? Is that what this is about? [SpongeBob and Patrick throw her into the ship] This isn't the moon! We're still in Bikini Bot-- [door is slammed shut]
SpongeBob: It just goes to show you: you can't trust anyone. [both stare at each other and pump their guns] So, you were an alien all the time and you didn't even tell me!
Patrick: I didn't even know!
SpongeBob: Yeah? Well, I got you now.
Patrick: Oh, but it's not you that's got me, it's... [Patrick catches himself with the gray netting as it turns out he had his gun pointed the wrong way] ...me that's got me!
SpongeBob: Boy, I can't wait to see the look on Sandy's face when she sees this! [ship runs out of gas and stops on the moon] Sandy, I'm back! [peeks out the window] Wow, Bikini Bottom sure looks different. [sees the Earth] Uh-oh...
Everyone else: SpongeBob, we "aliens" would like a word with you!
Mr. Krabs: [dancing and singing at Pearl's birthday party] ♪Yar-har, Pearl's my daughter, I'll spit in your eye! Yo-ho, Pearl's a whale, and it's her birthday, yar-yar-yar!♪ Ta-da!
Pearl: Thanks for the show, Dad. Now can we open the presents?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, all right. Presents for me darling little sardine. Here ya are. [places the present in front of Pearl]
Pearl: Oh, you shouldn't have. What is it, Daddy? It wouldn't be those totally hip new flipper slippers all my friends are using, would it? Everyone wants them.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh...they might be.
Pearl: Whee! [begins to unwrap present] Oh, you shouldn't have, yay, you shouldn't have. [sees present] I mean, Dad, [holds up big boots] you really shouldn't have! [Pearl's friends laugh]
Mr. Krabs: Pearl, these are the finest fishin' boots available!
Pearl: Dad, you ruined me! [cries]
Mr. Krabs: But I got them for a bargain! [the house shakes from Pearl's screaming and wailing; bubble transitions to the Krusty Krab] Oh, what am I gonna do? I spent two whole dollars on these boots and now I'm stuck with them!
SpongeBob: [peeks into Mr. Krabs' office] Oh, uhh, Mr. Krabs, can I get my paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBoy, me Bob! Come in. Come in, right this way, laddie! Have a seat anywhere, but not on these beautiful priceless boots. [SpongeBob sits down, but the boots are in his way, so he can't see Mr. Krabs] So you want to get paid?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sir, I can't see you. The boots [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] are in [leans over to one side and Mr. Krabs leans towards the other] the way.
Mr. Krabs: [pushes the boots aside] In the way? These boots never leave my sight! These are the most expensive and prized possessions I own.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? Why is that, they just look like any old ordinary boots.
Mr. Krabs: Ordinary boots? These are the only official fry cook boots! Only the finest fry cooks in the world are permitted to wear them! Part of a tradition. And these boots were given to me by the most famous fry cook in the sea.
SpongeBob: Who's that?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, uhh, oh, well, his name's not important, but he was famous, all right, don't you worry.
SpongeBob: ♪I'm ready! I'm ready! I want those boots!♪
Mr. Krabs: Sorry, son, these boots are far too valuable. [takes boots away]
SpongeBob: Hmmm.. I know! What if I give you my Krusty Krab paycheck?
Mr. Krabs: Paycheck! You got a deal--
SpongeBob: And what if I paint the Krusty Krab for free?
Mr. Krabs: You've got a deal.
SpongeBob: And I'll throw in a year's supply of French fry orders!
Mr. Krabs: You got a...
SpongeBob: And... [Mr. Krabs stops SpongeBob from saying anything else]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on there, lad! You're gonna give me a heart attack! [shakes SpongeBob's hand] You got yourself a deal.
[Squidward is drying off a glass when he looks through the glass and sees SpongeBob wearing boots]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward. Do you like my new boots? Pretty cool, huh? Now, I'm an official fry cook!
[SpongeBob bounces up and down in the boots, making them squeak, as Squidward watches. Then SpongeBob bounces harder until Squidward's head is bouncing up and down really hard trying to keep up. Then SpongeBob leaves to squeak his boots around the Krusty Krab.]
Squidward: That squeaking is gonna drive us all crazy!
Mr. Krabs: Nonsense, Squidward. That squeaking is money to my ears. I mean, music.
[Later that night, Mr. Krabs is in his room, lying in his hammock and imagining dollar bills jumping one-by-one into a cash register]
Mr. Krabs: [muttering] Money, money, money, money, money. Ten, twenty, thirty, forty... [all of a sudden, the pair of squeaky boots jumps into the register. He opens his eyes] Wha? Who's there? [rests his head on his pillow] Back to countin' me money. [closes his eyes again and imagines coins jumping into the register] One, two, three, four, five... [the boots appear again; Mr. Krabs opens his eyes again] What the barnacle is that? [he sees that the bedroom window is opening and shutting by itself, making squeaky noises. Mr. Krabs closes the window and gets back into bed, but notices the window has opened again. He walks back across the room to close it but steps into a hole and falls out the window, breaking the tip of his leg off in the process. He gets back into his bedroom, watches his step to avoid another hole and shuts the window, but it won't close. He starts shutting it with increasing force and speed until the window finally stays closed. The window reopens again, and Mr. Krabs gives it the "evil eye" followed by a growl. The window immediately closes back, as if it says "Yipe!" Mr. Krabs then starts to go back to bed, but he steps into the same hole he avoided earlier and breaks the tip of his other leg off. He screams as he gets flung into his hammock and gets all twisted up in it. Mr. Krabs can do nothing but lie there with bloodshot eyes as the window makes squeaky noises all night, as if it is clapping at him. Fade to the next morning; Mr. Krabs has his legs bandaged up as he drowsily walks to the Krusty Krab] Arrgh, that was the worst night I ever weathered. At least I'll have some peace and quiet at work. [As he walks up to the door, Squidward slams the doors open into Mr. Krabs' face]
Squidward: That's it, Mr. Krabs; I'm taking my vacation now.
Mr. Krabs: [muffled] What's wrong, Mr. Squid-ard?
Squidward: I can't take the world's greatest fry cook anymore! I'll see you in a week. [leaves the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: That fry cook's making me a fortune. What could be the problem?
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-Bob-ob. [every time SpongeBob's boots squeak, Mr. Krabs stutters. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs, but he is so tall, all Mr. Krabs can see is his boots]
Mr. Krabs: I... uhh, I see you're still wearing them boots.
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? I love them! Could the world's greatest fry cook do this? [runs in place fast with plates of Krabby Patties in each hand]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I don't... uhh... I don't... uhh...
SpongeBob: Or could he do this? [leans over to one table and sets the plate on the table without having to move from his spot at all] Or this? [leans to another table and puts a plate of patties on that table, then goes behind the register on top of the boat] And watch this, Mr. Krabs! [moves his boots around slightly, making them "talk"]
Squeaky Boots: May I take your order?
Francis: Yeah, I'll have the Krusty Special.
Squeaky Boots: Thank you, sir. I will squeak when it's ready.
SpongeBob: Could the greatest fry cook do that, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I, uhh...
SpongeBob: And watch this, Mr. Krabs. And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this. [does many different things with his boots until Mr. Krabs can't take it anymore]
Mr. Krabs: [his eyes go bloodshot] [screaming] I gotta go to my office! [puts seat cushions over his ears] I can still hear it! [puts chairs over his ears] It's still coming through! The infernal squeak! [he repeatedly bangs his head on his desk] Those boots have got to go! And I need an aspirin.
[that night, at SpongeBob's pineapple...]
SpongeBob: Gary, these boots have changed my life. I'm never taking them off.
Gary: [puts earplugs in] Meow.
SpongeBob: Good night, Gary.
[as SpongeBob is sleeping with his boots on, Mr. Krabs peeks over his diving board and climbs down, then takes his boots off and runs to the Krusty Krab, laughing quietly. Some hammering sounds are heard, then a rooster crows as night fades to morning]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quiet money. Silence and money. [SpongeBob bursts through the double doors]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What is it, my boy?
SpongeBob: [hugs Mr. Krabs while crying] Oh, Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry! Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry!
Mr. Krabs: It's okay, son.
SpongeBob: [cries harder and looks up at his boss with tears streaming down his face] No, it's not okay! I lost the boots! Your valuable boots, it's my fault, I let you down! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Ohh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
Mr. Krabs: Hold it, boy! It's not the end of the world.
SpongeBob: Yes, it is!
Mr. Krabs: Look, don't cry. I got some, uhh, some magic oven mitts! [holds up some oven mitts]
SpongeBob: [puts them on his feet, waits a second, then kicks them off] They're not the same! You were right. I wasn't ready for those blessed boots. [walks into the door, opens it, then goes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: Poor lad. [looks through the window and sees that SpongeBob is so upset, he has his head down... right on top of the hot grill]
Tom: Excuse me?
Mr. Krabs: I didn't do it! [sees Tom] Ohh, heh-heh, can I help ya?
Tom: Yeah, I'm ready to order.
Mr. Krabs: [takes out a notepad] What'll ya have?
Tom: I'll take a [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: [becomes surprised] What did you say?
Tom: I said, I'll take a [squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
SpongeBob: [still in tears] I heard his order, Mr. Krabs. He says he wants [squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: What?
Tom: And a [squeak squeak squeak squeak].
Mr. Krabs: Huh? [starts going insane, imagining everything and everyone squeaking] Huh? [looks at the menu and sees "squeak" as an item for everything] I didn't write that! [keeps thinking and hearing the squeaks. Even the dripping kitchen sink makes squeaking sounds instead of dripping sounds. Eventually he starts seeing visions of SpongeBob and his boots.]
SpongeBob: [in Mr. Krabs' head] Could the world's greatest fry cook do this?... And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this... [Mr. Krabs' eye starts swirling]
Mr. Krabs: [snaps] Stop it! [the customers look at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] Stop... it! [his eyes start contorting] Oh, oh, don't you hear it?! Yes, I did it! I did it! I took the boots! They're here, under the floorboards! [sobbing] Oh, please, make it stop! It's the squeaking of the hideous boots! [throws himself onto the floor and bawls] I'm sorry! But I can't take the infernal squeakin' no more! [lifts up the Krusty Krab and grabs the boots, with everyone screaming inside. He then walks into the kitchen with an evil expression on his face and puts the boots into a vat of grease, which shrinks them, and he eats them. After that, he opens the door to the dining room, and lets out a long burp] The deed is done.
SpongeBob: Umm, why did you eat my boots, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Because, lad, you didn't need 'em. It's not the boots, it's the boot-ee. I mean, uh, the person... in the boots. You're a great fry cook.
SpongeBob: You really think so, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: I do, son. [hands SpongeBob a stack of money] Here's the paycheck I owe you. [puts another stack of money on top of the first stack] Plus a bonus! [takes the bonus back] Well, there's your paycheck anyway. [walks away] I need a vacation.
SpongeBob: Bye, Mr. Krabs!
[fade to Mr. Krabs and Pearl taking a drive out to somewhere, with a camper behind their boat]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, a long week away from Bikini Bottom is exactly what I need, just me and my darling daughter Pearl.
Pearl: [lifts her feet over the side of the door to reveal her new shoes] Don't forget my new flipper slippers, Daddy!
Mr. Krabs: Darling, I won't. [as he laughs, he hiccups and the squeaky noise comes out] Oh, no. [continues to hiccup and squeak as they drive off into the distance] 
[SpongeBob is grilling Krabby Patties in the Krusty Krab kitchen until one of them suddenly levitates up from the grill and turns into a jellyfish. It floats out the window as the rest of the patties turn into jellyfish and do the same. SpongeBob follows them and flies out the window and turns into a jellyfish. He buzzes around Jellyfish Fields when he hears Mr. Krabs voice]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? SpongeBob! [the grill is on fire] Wake up, boy! You're burning me money! [SpongeBob wakes up from his dream and screams. Then runs behind Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what do we do?
Mr. Krabs: Here, use this! [Hands SpongeBob a fire extinguisher. SpongeBob throws it at the grill and sets the fire larger than before. Mr. Krab looks at SpongeBob for his stupidity, as he realizes his error. SpongeBob then tries to blow on the fire to put it out until a fireman comes into the kitchen with a hose and sprays SpongeBob with the water. SpongeBob enlarges and falls backwards, which puts out the fire]
Mr. Krabs and Fireman: Hooray! [SpongeBob shrinks and burns into a black sponge while Mr. Krabs scrapes him off the grill and on to a spatula]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, come into me office. [in Mr. Krabs office] What's wrong, boy?
SpongeBob: Well, I.
Mr. Krabs: This is the fourth time this week I've had to scrape you off of something.
SpongeBob: Well, I've been thinking.
Mr. Krabs: We need to get you thinking about work. [stretches his eyes out]
SpongeBob: No offense, Mr. Krabs, but I've been thinking about giving up my cold industrial life in favor of a more natural and free life among the jellyfish. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, SpongeBob, you wouldn't last even one day in the wild. This is your natural habitat. [shows kitchen] This is your wide open range. [shows grill] These are your amber waves. [shows greasy fryers] And this[picks up a spatula from the sink]oh, this is your golden scepter, with which you rule! That's better than nasty old jellyfish, right, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's gone] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [walks out the Krusty Krab] I can too last more than one day. I'll show him. Aw, barnacles! [throws his hat on the ground]
Mr. Krabs: [opens doors] SpongeBob, wait! [sees SpongeBob's hat on the ground and screams] Oh, he'll be back, alright. He'll be back. [SpongeBob is now giving his stuff away to his friends]
SpongeBob: And Squidward, I want you to have my can opener. [gives it to him]
Squidward: And I thought this friendship would never pay off. [walks away]
Patrick: [teary-eyed] Are-are-are-are you sure you want to give me this mayonnaise?
SpongeBob: It's all yours. [Patrick holds up a bunch of phone books]
Patrick: A-a-and these old phone books?
SpongeBob: All yours, old friend. [walks off and comes back with a case] Patrick, there is one more thing I want you to have. [opens up a rectangular box that has the words "Ol' Reliable" on the front. A glowing jellyfish net is inside. Patrick throws the phone books away and picks up Ol' Reliable]
Patrick: Ol' Reliable? [cries as Sandy walks up]
Sandy: Howdy, y'all. Hey, SpongeBob, you having a garage sale?
SpongeBob: No, Sandy, I'm giving up my material possessions to live in the wild with the jellyfish.
Sandy: SpongeBob, of all the crazy schemes. Why would you want to live among the jellyfish? They're cold and mean and none too bright. [SpongeBob pats Sandy's helmet]
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, Sandy. That's exactly the response I would expect from someone who lives the sham of a life I once lived. I'm gonna prove I don't need all this stuff to be happy. [walks away] Maybe someday you'll wise up and join me. Goodbye. [walks behind a bush and takes his pants off] I won't be needing these. [drops pants and runs away] Buzz, buzz, buzz.
Squidward: He took off his pants.
Sandy: I'll give him a week. [walks away]
Squidward: I'll give him eleven minutes. [walks away, throwing off the can opener at Patrick]
Patrick: Patrick sad! [at Jellyfish Fields]
SpongeBob: [touches Jellyfish Fields sign] I'm home. I'm home! I'm home! I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home, I'm home! [jellyfish knock SpongeBob down as they fly by] Brothers and sisters, wait for me! [jellyfish fly into a hive] Buzz buzz. Buzz buzz. Okay, I'm here! [jellyfish fly out of hive] Wait, I just got here. My jellyfish instincts tell me to go... [sticks his finger in his mouth and then in his head] ...that way. [points to where the jellyfish went] Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. [running after jellyfish all over the fields. Jellyfish devour a bunch of kelp. SpongeBob decides to try it but is disgusted and spits it out from his tongue] This is the life. [jellyfish are floating in the middle of the fields as SpongeBob walks into the middle of the group] Hey, everybody, buzz buzz. Buzz to you. Buzz, buzz, nice current today. Hey, what's the buzz? [wants to shake a jellyfish's hand] Hello, I'm JellyBob, and you are? [jellyfish stings him and his hand, causing it to start swelling] Uhh... nice to meet you. [hand gets huge and swollen. SpongeBob smells some aroma and goes to check and see that Patrick and Sandy are having a picnic with Krabby Patties]
Sandy: "Here, Patrick, have a Krabby Patty!" [whispers into Patrick's ear] There he is, Patrick. Say your line!
Patrick: [reading off script] "Why, thank you, Sandy, I would love one. [take patty.]" [takes patty] "Too bad SpongeBob isn't here. These are his favorites. I sure wish he'd come home. [take bite.]" [sniffles. tries to take a bite, but throws the patty and the script away and turns to SpongeBob] I can't do it! SpongeBob! Come back!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm not coming home.
Patrick: I miss you! [cuts to Sandy waving hello, but in guilt manner because of set-up] Sandy misses you! Even Squidward misses you! [Squidward is throwing himself a party at home]
SpongeBob: I'm happy here. This is my home now. [Sandy drags Patrick away]
Patrick: No! SpongeBob! [later, SpongeBob comes in wiggling his arms and legs like the jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Hey, everybody! I'm back! I think I'm getting the hang of this. [jellyfish float away as the net is swung at SpongeBob, which knocks him down. Patrick, breathing heavily, is ready to capture SpongeBob with Ol' Reliable] Patrick! What are you doing?
Patrick: If I can't have you as a friend, I'm gonna make you a trophy! [shows a jar with a label on the front that says SpongeBob - Friend] I even picked out this nice jar for you!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Go home! I'm a jellyfish now! [Patrick swings the net at SpongeBob but SpongeBob runs away. Patrick goes after him. SpongeBob hides behind a snail's shell, but the snail slithers off. SpongeBob goes to hide behind a rock]
Patrick: I can see you there! [SpongeBob hides behind a bush] I still see you! [SpongeBob hides behind another rock] You're gonna look good on my mantel! Friends forever, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob runs under neath an “N” shaped rock and peeks around. Patrick is underneath the rock on the top] I got you now, SpongeBob! [falls on the ground and misses SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Patrick! No! [Patrick runs after SpongeBob again as SpongeBob jumps into the jellyfish hive. Patrick tries to get the hive down with the net but fails multiple times]
Patrick: Okay! So this is the way it's gonna be. I hope you're happy. [breaks the net in half and walks away, sobbing]
SpongeBob: Well, that's over. Back to jellyfish matters. [a drop of jelly lands on SpongeBob nose. He samples it] Mmm, jelly. [eats a lot of jelly as the jellyfish come back toward the hive] Ah, my jellyfish brethren are returning. [jellyfish buzz into the hive] Greetings, comrades! [the jellyfish repeatedly shock SpongeBob and he screams. SpongeBob climbs out of the hive and runs as the jellyfish keep shocking him. Later, SpongeBob is in a cave] Being a jellyfish sure is fun. Buzz. [rips off a bushel of grass] Buzz. [pushes rock over as he uses it for his pillow] Buzz. [pushes the rock aside and gets cold. The blanket scrunches up, but SpongeBob pushes it back down. Blanket scrunches up again and SpongeBob gets cold] Hey! Eww, I'm itchy! Itchy, why am I so itchy! [takes off the blanket and reveals 9 poison sea urchins] Ah! Poison sea urchins! [screams and scratches the urchins off of him and runs out of the cave] Ow, ow, oh, itches. Ow, ow, itches. [crawls on the ground to stop the itching. Later, SpongeBob is walking home] Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. [buzzes fourteen more times as he walks up to the Krusty Krab door and sees a plate full of Krabby Patties on a table] Krabby Patties. [walks past Sandy's treedome, then he sniffles] Sandy. [still buzzing, walks up to his pineapple] What have I done? I had a great life and friends, and I gave all of that up. [opens the door and turns the light on. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, Patrick, and Gary are there to welcome him home]
All: Welcome home, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: You guys are the best! I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me!
Mr. Krabs: Ah, quit your blubbering and have a Krabby Patty. [hands him a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [eats it as Mr. Krabs places his Krusty Crew hat on his head]
Mr. Krabs: And I'll see you at work first thing tomorrow morning.
SpongeBob: [salutes] Aye, aye, captain!
Squidward: SpongeBob, do us all a favor. [hands SpongeBob his pants]
SpongeBob: Don't mind if I do. [puts on his pants] Ta-da. [hugs Squidward] Aww.
Squidward: Okay, that's enough. [everyone else hugs SpongeBob and Squidward]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: Can we please stop this? [everyone stops hugging]
Patrick: Patrick itchy! [everyone but SpongeBob starts to scratch themselves and crawl on the floor]
SpongeBob: It is great to be home!
[Squidward is sleeping and hears noises. He awakens, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick under his blanket with a sign that reads "happy birthday"]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Surprise! Happy birthday, Squidward! [all three standing in front of a cake] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday cake! [standing in front of a picture of a seahorse and Squidward has the tail] Happy happy birthday! Pin the tail on the seahorse! [surrounded by presents] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday, Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick run out of Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Patrick: Another year older. [laughs]
Squidward: It's not my birthday! [shuts door and takes off party hat] That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!
Realtor Lady: [looking at a picture of Squidward's house] Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles! [showing the Realtor lady as Patty Rechid from Bikini Realty on phone] I can sell your home in a heartbeat.
Squidward: Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
Patty: No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.
Squidward: Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say "neighbors?"
Patty: Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.
Squidward: Neighbors. Uhh...
Patty: Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then! [both hang up]
Squidward: SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite... [Later, SpongeBob is sleeping, but is awaken from Squidward's instrument playing outside]
SpongeBob: Umm, Squidward, why are you playing that drum? [Squidward stops playing]
Squidward: Drum? What drum? [puts the drum on the ground and punches a hole in it] This is just my wig case! See? [puts on the wig, kicks the drum out of the way and frolics around] Come on, SpongeBob, tackle me!
SpongeBob: Squidward! You need bed rest! [pushes Squidward to his house as Squidward is blowing bubbles] I'll keep you safe until you're well again.
Squidward: Oh, I get it. You don't know what day it is, do you?
SpongeBob: Uhh, Wednesday?
Squidward: Why, it's Opposite Day! [SpongeBob is confused] You mean you've never heard of it? Boy, have you been missing out! Opposite Day is the one day of the year when you get to act different! Normally I'm stuffy, boring, but today I'm silly and spontaneous!
SpongeBob: Does everybody know about Opposite Day?
Squidward: Oh sure! It's a game! Get it?
SpongeBob: Oh, a game.
Squidward: Yeah! Normally, you're really loud and annoying, so what are you going to be today?
SpongeBob: Quiet and out of the way! Yay!
Squidward: Yeah! Why don't you get a jump on it.
SpongeBob: I love... I mean, I hate Opposite Day. [giggles as he runs back into his pineapple] I'm not ready!
Squidward: So long, chum. [takes off wig] And goodbye, Bikini Bottom.
SpongeBob: [running to Gary] Gary! It's Opposite Day and I... [stops running] ...walk, don't run. And I'm gonna... opposite... opposite... I'm just gonna crawl into bed and do nothing all day. [crawls into bed] Too bad it only comes once a year, huh, Gary?
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: Gary, where’s your holiday spirit?
Gary: [barks like a dog]
SpongeBob: [doorbell rings] Company! I hate company. Who's there?
Patrick: It's Patrick!
SpongeBob: Patrick... go away! I never want to see you again! [giggles, but Patrick cries]
Patrick: [sobbing] SpongeBob doesn't like me anymore!
SpongeBob: [opens door] That's right! You're my worst enemy! [Patrick falls to the ground, bawling] Patrick, you're not really not my friend. It's just Opposite Day!
Patrick: Opposite Day? Hey, I've heard of that!
SpongeBob: You have?
Patrick: No! What is it?
SpongeBob: Well, whatever you normally do, today you do the opposite.
Patrick: Oh! Let me try! Let me try! [Patrick holds his breath and turns purple]
SpongeBob: Patrick! Patrick, breathe! [He takes a deep breath in and pants] Not that opposite. Let me show you how to do it the wrong way!
[SpongeBob and Patrick dance across the screen as SpongeBob is pink and Patrick is yellow. Gary eats properly from a table]
SpongeBob: [eats from Gary's bowl] Meow.
Patrick: [sitting on newspapers] Meow.
[SpongeBob and Patrick both blow a bubble, but they blow themselves into bubbles, instead. Patrick pops]
SpongeBob: Kcirtap yeh. [forwards: Hey Patrick.]
Patrick: Pu evig i. [forwards: I give up.]
SpongeBob: Edis etisoppo eht ot teg ot! [forwards: To get to the opposite side.]
[Both laugh in reverse. Cut back to house]
SpongeBob: Say, want to help me do some work around the house, worst enemy?
Patrick: Nope. [He smiles, both laugh]
Squidward: Nearly noon and not a peep from SpongeBob! [packing his belongings into boxes] I'm almost sorry I'm leaving! [laughs] Opposite Day. [hears noises from outside] SpongeBob, what are you... [screams as he sees both SpongeBob and Patrick destroying SpongeBob's pineapple]
SpongeBob: Hello, Squidward! Oops. I mean, goodbye, Squidward! Aww, isn't Opposite Day... [giggles] ...terrible? [laughs]
Squidward: I'll tell you what's terrible! Living next to you! You're the worst neighbor in history!
SpongeBob: Wow! That's the nicest thing Squidward has ever said to me! [Squidward facepalms]
Squidward: [panicked] If the real estate agent sees that mess, I'll never sell this house! [SpongeBob and Patrick look at the destroyed pineapple]
Patrick: Isn't it beautiful?
SpongeBob: On Opposite Day it is. [Squidward drives up with a bulldozer]
Squidward: Out of the way, SpongeBob! [Squidward begins to rebuild the pineapple]
SpongeBob: I don't get it. I made my house a mess, which was making it clean, which made Squidward clean my yard, [he wraps his arms around himself repeatedly] but that really means he's messing it up. [Patrick is drooling] But the opposite of clean is filth, which means filth is clean, that means Squidward is really making my yard a wreck, but I normally wreck my own yard which means, [Gary meows] Squidward is being the opposite of Squidward which means he's SpongeBob! [SpongeBob wrapped his arms around himself] A-ha! I understand everything now! I must be the opposite of SpongeBob! By being... [stretches his nose out and puts his belt around the middle of his head to resemble Squidward's head and talks like Squidward] Squidward!
Patrick: Hey! I wanna be opposite, too! [SpongeBob thinks, then snaps his fingers. He takes a piece of coral and puts it below Patrick's eyes where his nose would be] Yeah! Finally! Yoo-hoo! [dances] I'm Squidward, I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Wait! It's not enough to look like Squidward to be opposite... [talking like Squidward] ...you have to act like him, too. Boy, oh boy, do I like playing the clarinet. I practice and practice all day long, but I never get any better. [normal voice again] Now you try.
Patrick: Okay. [takes a deep breath and continues dancing] I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward, Squidward. [SpongeBob dances along with Patrick]
SpongeBob and Patrick: I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward. I'm Squidward, Squidward, Squidward.
SpongeBob: [opens door for Patrick] After you, Mr. Squidward.
Patrick: Why, thank you, Mr. Squidward. [walks in]
SpongeBob: You're quite welcome, Mr. Squidward. [walks in and shuts the door]
Squidward: [still rebuilding SpongeBob's pineapple] Oh, Opposite Day. Next time, it's going to be "Go Jump Off A Cliff Day!" [as he is building, Patty Rechid drives up]
Patty: Oh my! The house is even more beautiful in person! [walks up to the front door, knocks on the door. SpongeBob opens it] Hello, Mr... [looks down] Uh... Mr. Tentacles?
SpongeBob: [talking like Squidward] Yes, please come in.
Patty: It's funny, I pictured you being much taller.
SpongeBob: Yeah, everyone says that.
Patty: Now if you want the sale to go through, you've got to tell me all the positive things about your house.
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Positive things! Opposite Day... [talking like Squidward] I'd love to. The floor creaks, the roof leaks, there's a terrible draft.
Patty: Uhh... well, you didn't mention that on the phone.
SpongeBob: Please, let me finish. The winters are harsh, the summers are brutal. There's a wild man-eating clam in the backyard! [Patty looks at him, shocked] Now, would you care to see the rest of my home?
Patty: Well, umm, I'm not sure if I'm interested...
SpongeBob: Nonsense! I won't take no for an answer. [laughs then stops] Please follow me. [both walk into Squidward's art room] And here's the worst room in the house. My gallery.
Patty: [looks at painting of Squidward] Oh my, this painting is very nice. [Patrick bursts through the painting]
Patrick: Thank you! [Patty screams and leaps up to the ceiling, hanging onto a beam]
Patty: Who's that?!
SpongeBob: I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Squidward.
Patty: You're both Squidward?
SpongeBob: I'm Squidward, he's Squidward.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're both Squidward.
Squidward: Well, that's done. At least SpongeBob has been quiet. [sees Patty's boat and screams] NO! [SpongeBob plays Squidward's clarinet badly for Patty]
Patty: Okay, I really don't want to hear another one.
SpongeBob: Okay. [plays more]
Patty: I really don't want to hear more, thank you.
SpongeBob: I hear you loud and clear. [plays more]
Squidward: [bursts in] Stop! Get away from her! Oh, oh, I am so sorry, ma'am, I hope these two [turns to them] barnacle heads [turns back to Patty] haven't harmed you in any way.
Patty: Who are you?
Squidward: Why, I'm Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick pop up in the background. Patty's face slowly turns annoyed]
Patty: [stands up from chair] What kind of fool do you take me for?! [to Patrick] He's Squidward, [to SpongeBob] he's Squidward, [to the real Squidward] you're Squidward?! I'm Squidward!! Are there any other Squidwards I should know about?!!
Gary: [with a pickle on his face. Imitates Squidward's voice] Meow.
Patty: [shocked then angry] I'm outta here. [she walks away]
Squidward: Ma'am, please! What about my house?!
Patty: I wouldn't sell a house for you if you were the last Squidward on earth!!! [walks out of the house]
Squidward: Wait!
SpongeBob: Don't...
Patrick: ...Go!
Squidward: [screams, runs out, and holds onto her leg, dragging him, as she is leaving] No, no, no, no, no!
Patty: Stop! Stop!
Squidward: Please, sell my house!
Patty: Never!!! [releases her leg, gets in her boat]
Squidward: Don't leave me here! [falls to the ground, crying. Patty drives off]
SpongeBob and Patrick: [happily walk up to Squidward] Happy Opposite Day, Squidward! We hate you! [Squidward seethes with fury, then gets an idea]
Squidward: Let me show you guys how much I... hate you! [Squidward drives up with the bulldozer chasing SpongeBob and Patrick, they both scream and run away]
SpongeBob: Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that Squidward likes us too much?
Squidward: [angry, still chasing them] Happy Opposite Day! [chases them down the street and laughs evilly] 
[No customers are at the Krusty Krab as Mr. Krabs is holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, Squidward is reading a ballet magazine and imagining his head on the dancers, and SpongeBob is wiping dust off tables.]
[Closer shot of Mr. Krabs holding a 'FREE' sign for the salad bar, attempting to retain his smile. Piece of paper flies through the open door of the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: Hmm... I just don't get it. If a free salad bar doesn't bring in customers, what will?! [Squidward is dancing] Squidward!
Squidward: Uh-uh... Yes, sir?
Mr. Krabs: There's gonna be some changes around here. [Francis walks in. Mr. Krabs gasps] A customer! Welcome to the Krusty Krab! [runs up to Francis with a chair and seats him. Brings him back to the table] SpongeBob, cater to his every whim. And don't screw this one up.
SpongeBob: Aye aye sir! Welcome aboard, sir! Here at the Krusty Krab, you are the captain, and I am your cabin boy. You just say the word and I will throw myself in the brig! May I take your order?
Francis: All I wanted was change for the payphone. [shows the dollar]
SpongeBob: Aye-aye, sir! [runs off quickly and comes back with change. Talking in a French accent] Monsieur's change. [snaps his fingers]
Francis: Thanks. [laughs nervously and leaves a penny on the table] Here you go. [runs off as Mr. Krabs smells the penny]
Mr. Krabs: Yeah! [jumps on it. Later, Mr. Krabs' puts the penny away in his safe in his office and is with Squidward and SpongeBob] Now as you may have noticed, profits are way down this month. [pulls down a chart with zig-zag lines going down and his eyes sticking out on each side] We've got to think of a gimmick to bring in customers. [pulls the chart up] Do you lubbers have any ideas?
SpongeBob: I've got one! [takes out a tray with a soda and a pair of socks on it] A free pair of socks with every purchase! Or maybe 'Double Patty Midnight Madness'! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! I know! I know! I know! How about 'mouth full of clams' day! Everyone who shows up with a mouthful of clams... [talks with mouth full of clams] ...gets a free drink! Huh? Huh?
Mr. Krabs: Well, uhh, I was thinking more along the lines of live entertainment. [Squidward gasps]
Squidward: That's it, a floor show! Wait, a talent show! With your host, me! [runs up to Mr. Krabs with stars in his eyes] This is the moment I've... [eyes return to normal] I mean, we've been dreaming of. Think of it, Mr. Krabs, you will be responsible for bringing culture to this cultural wasteland we call Bikini Bottom! And not to mention, the money.
Mr. Krabs: The money? [Squidward is lying on the table]
Squidward: And I can see it now... your daughter Pearl, her name up in lights.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs looks at his picture of him and Pearl] Little Pearly... a star?
SpongeBob: Hoppin' clams! A talent show! I'm talented! I'd better call my folks! [runs off as Squidward and Mr. Krabs shake hands]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward, you've got a deal. Make my little girl a star! [later, the restaurant is being redecorated for the show. Squidward is writing notes on a notepad.]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, what time am I going on?
Squidward: Going on what?
SpongeBob: The show! When am I going on the show? I have a great act!
Squidward: What talent could you possibly possess? [SpongeBob blows a big bubble which turns into a hippo. Then blows two small bubbles for the hat and cane. Both dance]
SpongeBob: Ta-da! [Squidward yawns]
Squidward: No one, not even your parents, would want to see that. [hippo bubble pops] What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
SpongeBob: Ok, I get it. Don't worry, Squidward, I'm going to come up with the most cultured act ever!
Squidward: I can hardly wait. [SpongeBob runs off] Phew. The only culture that guy has is in his tennis shoes. [laughs] Tennis shoes. I crack myself up. [now the night of the talent show where people are outside conducting interviews and people inside are talking and getting set-up]
Lisa: [Talking in the background] We are now at the Krusty Krab Talent Show featuring the finest talent in the town...
SpongeBob: [peeks out from behind the curtain] Wow! A full house! [gasps] There's Mom and Dad! They are gonna be so proud! [Mr. Krabs shakes Mr. SquarePants' hand]
Mr Krabs: Hello, I'm Mr. Krabs, and I like money.
SpongeBob: I gotta get ready! [Squidward gets everyone's attention]
Squidward: Alright, people, listen up. Gather around everyone, chop, chop. [performers gather around] Now, you may be thinking this is your one shot at the big time. Well, it's not. It's mine.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squid! How about this for the show? [runs off and runs back with a tub full of water and the words 'Mister Absorbency' written on the front] The Amazing Mister Absorbency! [puts his finger in the water and absorbs it. Absorbs the water into his legs] Ta-da! [absorbs water into his head] Ta-da!
Squidward: No one is going to watch you engorge yourself. [grabs Squidward's legs]
SpongeBob: Please, Squidward, let me be in the show! I'll do anything! Anything! Anything!
Squidward: So you really want to be in the show?
SpongeBob: Oh, yes!
Squidward: Okay, you get to mop up afterwards. [hands SpongeBob a mop] Now will you stop bugging me? [walks off]
SpongeBob: So, this is what it feels like... the big time! With this mop, I shape my destiny! [show starts and crowd applauds. Squidward comes out and gets the cue cards that are in his tuxedo]
Squidward: Good evening and welcome to the 1st annual Squidward Tentacles Talent Show. Sponsored by the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty, because no one else would give it a home. [Patrick laughs] Thank you. Our next act is living proof that nepotism is alive and well. [Patrick laughs again] Put your fins together for... [Patrick cracks up laughing very hard. Bashes on the table with laughter, shaking dinnerware. He falls off his chair] Put your... [Patrick laughs] Put... [Patrick laughs] Pearl. [crowd claps as curtain rises for Pearl, dressed in cheerleader uniform]
Mr. Krabs: Hooray! My little girl is finally a star.
Pearl: Give me a K-R-U! [jumps up and down on the stage causing the crowd to fly up and down with her] Give me a S-T-Y! [jumps up and down again] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down] Krusty Krab! [jumps up and down]
Mr. Krabs: [He, Patrick, and SpongeBob's parents get tossed up and down. Mr. Krabs appear happy.] That's what I call talent! [Krusty Krab floor is destroyed]
Pearl: Thank you!
Fred: My leg! Ugh!
Pearl: Thank you, thank you! [Squidward closes curtain and as he is lowering the rope, SpongeBob is tied to it holding a mop and a bucket of water.]
Squidward: [Screams in shock]
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward, listen. What do you think? When I mop, should I go forward and back? No, no wait, side to side. [Squidward lets the rope go and sends SpongeBob flying up. Then he walks back out on the stage]
Squidward: And now, poetry. [walks backstage but peeks his head through the curtain] By Gary. [curtain opens. Gary is on a stool]
Gary: [clears throat] Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.
Sandy: He has such a way with words.
Squidward: [checks his watch] Come on, come on, Ginsburg, if he doesn't hurry it up, we're not going to have time for the best act... me! [SpongeBob walks up]
SpongeBob: Squidward, should I use Mr. Cleanser or Dr. Clean?
Squidward: Yes. [audience applauds as curtain opens, revealing Plankton in a magician costume and a sign that says 'The Amazing Plankton!']
Plankton: I, the amazing Plankton, with the use of prestidigitation... [turns his wand into flowers] ...will make a Krabby Patty disappear before your very eyes. [throw the flowers aside] First, I'll need a volunteer from the audience. [jumps onto a table and grabs the Krabby Patty from the customer. Runs toward the door, but Mr. Krabs stops Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Nice try. Your act's over, bub. [grabs the patty]
Plankton: You may win this time. Shia-kazing! [he claps his hands and ignites into a mini-explosion. The smoke from the explosion clears and he is completely charred] Well, this stinks. [he walks off and is booed. Mr. Krabs runs up to Squidward backstage, leaving a trail of flames]
Mr. Krabs: Squidward! [Literally races towards him, like an overspeeding race car] This show is a disaster! You're ruining me!
Squidward: Now, now, don't you worry, Mr. Krabs. I've saved the best for last, you'll see.
Mr. Krabs: For your sake, I hope you're right. [bunch of spot lights gleam around Krusty Krab]
Squidward: And now, ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for. We've saved the best for last. Put your hands together for the incomparable Squidward! ['Squidward Live' words blink in pink and green lights. Curtain opens and the background shows a canyon. Squidward dances with birds, accompanied by classical music. Then the lights go dark and music becomes techno as Squidward dances weirdly. Makes weird noises as he dances after the first part of his dance.]
Fish: What the?!
[Squidward continues to dance weirdly. Crowd boos and pelts tomatoes at Squidward]
Mr Krabs: I'm losing money on this deal! [puts a $1.00 sticker over the free sign on the salad bar. Grins.]
Fred: It's worth every penny. [everyone runs up to Mr. Krabs with dollar bills in hand]
Squidward: You bottom feeders! You don't even know talent!
Crowd: No talent! No talent! No talent! [curtain closes]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, can I go on now?
Squidward: Yeah, show's over! [crown continues booing as SpongeBob walks out and mops up the tomatoes. Crowd gets interested in this and applauds at him]
Crowd: Hey, yeah. That's really not bad. I like that. Alright! [SpongeBob briefly stops mopping and the crowd becomes silent. He then starts mopping faster getting even more applause. He then leaves stage right and the applause stops. He peeks from where he left and mops the floor while leaving stage left which starts the applause again. He waves goodbye to the crowd]
Squidward: They want an encore! [pushes SpongeBob away] Stand aside, SpongeBob! [Squidward jumps out and the crowd grows silent. He goes backstage and SpongeBob comes back out mopping and crowd cheers again. SpongeBob leaves stage left as Squidward jumps out again and the crowd instantly becomes silent again. Squidward is angry.]
[Squidward goes backstage and grabs SpongeBob. Then shows the crowd SpongeBob and they cheer. Then he puts his own head through the curtain and the crowd goes silent.]
[SpongeBob's arm gets a cheer, but Squidward's does not. SpongeBob's leg is shown then curtain rises and SpongeBob is mopping. Curtain closes then opens to reveal Squidward mopping and the crowd goes silent.]
[Squidward stops and he is angry. He tries to mop somewhere else to impress them. He then raises his hands up in a ta-da moment, but someone in the crowd throws a tomato and SpongeBob sweeps it up as the crowd cheers. Backstage, Harold and Margaret SquarePants bring Mr. Krabs up in a wheelbarrow full of money]
Mr. Krabs: You did it, Squidward! What a great show!
Mrs. SquarePants: Oh, my son's a star!
Mr. SquarePants: Who ever knew he had such talent.
Mr. Krabs: I'll be needing another wheelbarrow for next week's show! [crowd throws flowers at SpongeBob]
Narrator: Ahh, lunchtime at the Krusty Krab. Everyone is enjoying their Krabby Patties. [lights go off and sirens and red lights blare as everyone in the Krusty Krab screams and runs for cover] Huh?! What's this? [doors and windows are now metal]
Mr. Krabs: Can you spot him, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: [up in a crows nest with a telescope] Down there, sir! [a Krabby Patty is bouncing to the door]
Narrator: [gasps] There appears to be a Krabby Patty napping in progress! [Krabby Patty shoots a laser hole big enough for it to go through at the door] There can only be one culprit: Plankton!
Plankton: Finally, victory is mine! I win, I win, I win! [laughs]
Squidward: He got away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: [devastated] No! He's finally stolen me secret recipe!
Narrator: Perhaps not, Monsieur Krabs, for it's... [SpongeBob tears himself into another SpongeBob and flies off] ...SpongeBob SquarePants! [later, SpongeBob peeks out through under the sewer with binoculars in his hand. Catches a peek at a Krabby Patty jumping through the crowd]
SpongeBob: A-ha! [chases it behind some buildings] Hey! [Plankton flies up with a propeller. SpongeBob takes the twirling club that the cop is using as a propeller and flies after the Krabby Patty to the top of a building] Okay, that's far enough! Huh? [patty jumps off building] Tartar sauce! [uses his hat as a balloon-like ball and jumps off the building. Bounces off the ground towards the Krabby Patty. Bounces past a cowboy and a cowgirl]
Cowboy: Yeehaw! [Plankton walks into a magic shop and comes back out with funny glasses on]
SpongeBob: Have you seen a Krabby Patty? It's about this tall and... [looks up and reads the sign MAGIC SHOP] Wow, a magic shop! Are you a magician? One time, I saw this magician and he did this thing...anyway, and then he told us, "If you believe in yourself and with a tiny pinch of magic, all of your dreams can come true." [Plankton takes away Krabby Patty]
Plankton: Argh! I can't take it!
SpongeBob: Plankton! It's you!
Plankton: Yes! And after all these years, I thought I was the master of torture. But that... that just wasn't fair! Here. Take the stupid patty, I don't want the secret recipe anyway. I guess my restaurant will never be as good as the Krusty Krab. You don't know what it's like to be a loser. [cries]
SpongeBob: Aww, cheer up, Plankton. I think you're a winner.
Plankton: [stops crying] Wh-what did you say?
SpongeBob: I said, you're a-- [a bunch of people run up and point at Plankton]
All: Loser! [Plankton jumps away from group and walks back to his restaurant]
Squidward: How does it feel to be the most hated thing in Bikini Bottom, Plankton?! It hurts, doesn't it?! I know!
Policeman: Yeah, and for running you out, we're going to make this kid honorary town rookie of the day. [puts a big donut with a ribbon on it around SpongeBob]
Squidward, Mr. Krabs, the policeman, Fred, Tammy, Joe, Millie, Ricardo, and Stella: ♪For he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie, for he's a jolly good rookie...♪
[Everyone throws SpongeBob into the air.]
SpongeBob: [thinking to himself] I'll bet if he had just one friend, he wouldn't be such a meanie.
All: [as SpongeBob comes down, they stop singing] Which no... whatever. [everyone walks away. Later, Plankton hears a knock on his door at his restaurant]
Plankton: A customer? [opens door] Our special today is chum... [sees SpongeBob at the door] ...balaya.
SpongeBob: Hi, Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Haven't you degraded me enough for one day?
SpongeBob: No. I mean...I want you to come out and play with me.
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Play with me.
Plankton: You know how to induce thermonuclear fusion?
SpongeBob: No, but I like to go jelly... [Plankton closes the door]
Plankton: That naïve cube! How long must I suffer this?
Karen: You're not letting him leave, are you? Can't you see? This is the perfect opportunity for revenge!
Plankton: Elaborate. [computer shows images of a Krabby Patty and SpongeBob]
Karen: Befriend the SpongeBob, then when the time is just right, take the Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Take the Krabby Patty? [runs back to the door]
Karen: Get moving, genius, don't let him get away.
SpongeBob: [Plankton opens the door] ...fishing with my friends at Jellyfish Fields.
Plankton: Alright, SpongeBob, I'll play your little game.
SpongeBob: Great! [SpongeBob grabs Plankton and runs off] Last one to the fields is a rotten clam! [now at Jellyfish Fields] So, I get the big net and you get the little net. [hands Plankton a net bigger than him]
Plankton: What happens after we eat 'em?
SpongeBob: You don't eat 'em, you catch 'em, like this! [captures a jellyfish] Like that.
Plankton: And?
SpongeBob: And then you throw them back. But watch out for the stingers!
Plankton: Stingers? [Plankton imagines ruling Bikini Bottom with a jellyfish that only he controls] All knees will bow to Plankton! Hail, Plankton! I win, I win! [end of fantasy] I win, I wi--
SpongeBob: It's not about winning, it's about fun!
Plankton: What's that?
SpongeBob: Fun is when you... fun is... it's like... it's kinda... sorta like a...
SpongeBob: What is fun? Let me spell it for you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me, N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea.♪
Plankton: ♪F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium... bombs! N is for no survivors, when you-♪
SpongeBob: Plankton! Those things aren't what fun is all about. Now, do it like this: ♪F is for friends who do stuff to-♪
Plankton: Never! That's completely idiotic!
SpongeBob: Here, let me help you. ♪F is for friends who do stuff together, U is for you and me.♪ Try it!
Plankton: ♪N is for anywhere, anytime at all!♪
Clams: ♪Down here in the deep blue sea!♪
Plankton: Wait, I don't understand this, I feel all tingly inside. Should we stop?
SpongeBob: No! That's how you're suppose to feel!
Plankton: Well, I like it. Let's do it again!
SpongeBob: Okay!
SpongeBob and Plankton: ♪F is for frolic through all the flowers, U is for ukulele. N is nose-picking, chewing gum, and sand-licking, here with my best buddy. Hahahahahahahaha!♪
[Mr. Krabs is looking through a telescope at SpongeBob and Plankton]
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, mutiny.
[At the Chum Bucket, Plankton is changing clothes.]
Plankton: And after that, we frolicked through the flowers, and then we...
Karen: Sounds like fun.
Plankton: Well, the really fun part was when we...
Karen: What did you do with the Krabby Patty?
Plankton: The what? [shows a Krabby Patty on Karen's computer screen]
Karen: The Krabby Patty, remember?
Plankton: You can't rush these things, you know.
Karen: You're forgetting about the mission! [shows a formula]
Plankton: What are you talking about?
Karen: You're going native, Plankton! Look at yourself! [metal arm picks up Plankton and shows him wearing square pants like SpongeBob's]
Plankton: What?
[cuts to Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: I haven't seen Plankton in a while. He must be scheming.
SpongeBob: Who knows? Maybe he's changed.
Mr. Krabs: Who knows? I think you knows! [shows a picture of him and Plankton holding up the letters for FUN]
SpongeBob: He's changed, I tell you! [Plankton enters]
Plankton: SpongeBuddy! Yoo-hoo! [SpongeBob runs over to Plankton]
SpongeBob: Plankton-buddy! Let’s go! I forgot this is a no friend zone!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, may I speak to you in private. [talking to Plankton] You won't mind if I set this here, will you? [puts a plate with a Krabby Patty on the table and pushes it toward him]
SpongeBob: What's this all about, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: He's a thief. Look at the lust in his eye, he's...
SpongeBob: Why can't you just accept our friendship?
Mr. Krabs: He's just after me recipe. I'll prove it to you. [walks up to Plankton] Ah, you must be hungry after that long walk over here.
Plankton: Oh, yes, but I'm saving my appetite for some popcorn at the movies.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... suit yourself. [walks off then comes back to push the plate closer to Plankton. Uses a fan to get the smell to Plankton]
SpongeBob: We've had enough of your little tests, Mr. Krabs! [turns the fan off] Come on, Plankton, let's get out of here. [both walk away]
Mr. Krabs: Maybe the lad was right. Maybe Plankton's gone straight. [plate falls down revealing that it was cardboard] And maybe scallops will fly out of my pants! [takes the boat and paddles to the movies] Hang on there, laddie, I'm a-comin! [at the movies, SpongeBob and Plankton are sitting in the front row. SpongeBob is giving popcorn to Plankton as he is eating some himself. Then Bubble Bass comes down and sits on Plankton, squishing him]
SpongeBob: I sure like sequels, Plankton. [sees Bubble Bass in his spot] Hey, Bubble Bass, you're sitting on my friend. [Bubble Bass meanly smiles and gets comfortable in his seat, and a squelching sound comes from Plankton being squashed by his butt] Hey, Bubble Bass! [throws some popcorn and Bubble Bass runs after it]
Plankton: Thanks for that, friend.
SpongeBob: Sure thing.
Mr. Krabs: Listen up! [Mr. Krabs shadow is on the movie screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs? [in the projector room]
Mr. Krabs: He's deceiving ya! Reach into his pocket now and take what he's got! [the ladies didn't understand, so they reach in their husbands pockets and take out a watch, some money and a piggy bank then run off] You too, boy! [SpongeBob reaches into Plankton's pocket and takes out a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I cant believe this!
Plankton: It's not what you think.
SpongeBob: What is it then? Tell me what you see here!
Plankton: I... I don't see anything.
SpongeBob: [starting to cry] How can you not see it!? [groans]
Plankton: [beginning to tear up as well] Okay, okay, I see it! It's a Krabby Patty, okay?! I couldn't help it!
SpongeBob: But we sang The F.U.N. Song! [clutches his stomach] I think I'm gonna be sick! How long?
Plankton: How long what?
SpongeBob: [grabs Plankton, holding him in his fist] How long were you planning on doing this?! [tears well up in SpongeBob's eyes] Tell me!
[Plankton puts his head down and begins to sob.]
SpongeBob: [the tears now dripping down his face] What?!
Plankton: [looks up at SpongeBob] All right, it's true! I tricked you to get the Krabby Patty! But then you showed me friendship! [the two look each other in the eyes] And now I realize... that's all I really wanted!
SpongeBob: [sniffs, then smiles, beginning to stop crying] Really?
Plankton: [Plankton grabs the patty and jumps towards the screen] No, not really. Being evil is too much fun! [laughs evilly]
Movie Man: Oh, darling, I know that nothing could ever tear us apart. [Plankton rips through the screen]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, he's gone. He got the patty. He won.
Mr Krabs: Ho-ho, no he didn't, boy! Don't you know what’s behind these screens? Solid concrete! [laughs. Plankton is squished on the wall groaning. Mr. Krabs takes the Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. I thought Plankton had changed.
Mr. Krabs: Don't blame him, lad. No friendship could withstand the allure of a Krabby Patty! Now let's go back to the Krusty Krab and have a fresh one on me!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Well, maybe on a discount. [Mr. Krabs flicks Plankton off the wall and onto Bubble Bass' jelly beans]
Plankton: Huh? [Plankton runs around Bubble Bass's hand getting chased by his other hand] Yee... AAH! 
SpongeBob: It's time to grow myself large and wide.
[He grows himself large and wide as he is saying it. Walks over to his weight, which is a pink bunny and a blue bear and has trouble lifting it, but manages to get it over his head anyway. The doorbell rings and SpongeBob opens door]
Sandy: Howdy, SpongeBob. How's it goin'?
SpongeBob: Not too close, Sandy. I tend to get smelly when I'm pumping iron. Check it out. [shows off his muscles, but is still a weakling]
Sandy: Well, you're smelly.
SpongeBob: All thanks to my state-of-the-art work set. [shows all sorts of stuffed animals]
Sandy: Uhh... I don't wanna disappoint you, SpongeBob, but you won't see any progress with those.
SpongeBob: Oh, really?
Sandy: That is, if you want arms like these. [rolls up right sleeve, and flexes her right arm, showing off a big, impressive bicep] Or these! [rolls up other sleeve and flexes left arm, revealing her other bicep] Or these! [shows off her powerful back muscles while executing a back double bicep flex. SpongeBob's arm wiggles in the air]
SpongeBob: Well, uhh, maybe I could use a little help.
Sandy: Well, if you want arms like mine, you just gotta follow my training program.
SpongeBob: Wow, really? That'd be great, Sandy! I can see me now. [imagines himself with muscles and very tall working at the Krusty Krab, singing and jellyfishing at Jellyfish Fields & telling Gary goodnight, too big for his bed] Yeah... that would change everything!
Sandy: Be at my place at 5 a.m. Oh! And you'll need a water helmet. [puts a fish bowl on his head. Now the scene cuts to Sandy's tree dome, where SpongeBob is trying to do push-ups] Come on, SpongeBob, it's only push-ups! Come on. Come on! You can do it! [SpongeBob is grunting at this point determined to get a push-up. His body cracks and falls down while his arms stay up]
SpongeBob: One. [acorn bell dings]
Sandy: [in boxing ring with gloves on] Alright, put 'em up!
SpongeBob: [struggles getting his gloves up] They're up.
Sandy: Ding ding! [punches SpongeBob out of the ring. Later, Sandy starts up her exercise wheel with SpongeBob on it. SpongeBob pants while the wheel goes faster and makes him trip all over the wheel] Feeling the burn?
SpongeBob: I'm-fee-ling-some-thing! [launches out of the wheel and into the tree dome glass]
Sandy: Well, now that we've got warmed up, it's time for the arm-cruncher.
SpongeBob: Arm-cruncher, great. [looks over and sees two cement blocks slamming into the cement pedestal] This squirrel's trying to kill me!
Sandy: [walks up to the arm-cruncher with phone in hand] This is it.
SpongeBob: Hey, that's great, Sandy. Well, I sure had fun, we'll have to do it again sometime, bye. [hangs up] This working-out thing isn't working out. [arms bulge in and out] Ow. Ow. Ow.
TV: Hey, you! Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! "Oh, I'm a little peanut worm." Are you too much of a wimp to work out? Are you a weakling built like a sponge? Well, now you too can have muscles.
SpongeBob: Huh?
TV: With Anchor arms! [puts a long pink blow-up item on his arm] They slip on like a glove. Just add air. [puts a plug in the arm's hole and pumps air into it] How big do you want 'em? [pumps air into other arm] Normal? [puts more air into arm] Veiny? And for the ladies... [puts air into arm which makes it grow hair] ...hairy. [SpongeBob whistles as the TV puts up an image of a weak shark] I was a wimp before Anchor arms. Now, I'm a jerk and everybody loves me. So order now, wimp!
SpongeBob: Wow, now that's a good idea!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I wanna be just like him. Yeah, I've gotta get to a phone! [later, a big shadow of SpongeBob is walking down the road past Squidward, who is licking a popsicle] Hi, Squidward!
Squidward: [Tongue stuck to popsicle while looking up.] SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: [Next scene is Mr. Krabs sweeping the outside of the Krusty Krab. He looks up.] Huh?
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Mother of pearl! [hides in the Krusty Krab. Now, at Mussel Beach where everyone is lifting weights. SpongeBob comes in and makes one guy drop a big weight on two others' feet]
Fish: Ow...
SpongeBob: Hi, guys. [shows off new muscles]
Larry: SpongeBob, is that you?
SpongeBob: [walking on his hands] Who were you expecting, Tiny Tim? Wait... wait... [flexes those muscles] They're big, aren't they?
Larry: Dude, you're ripped!
SpongeBob: [flexes out the words] Thank...You. I've been working out. Excuse me a second. [flexes more] Yeah. Anyone up for the... [flexes muscles into drinks] ...juice bar? (bubble transition to juice bar)
Scooter: I'm tellin' ya, he's huge!
Sandy: Have you guys seen SpongeBob anywhere?
Scooter: You mean 'MuscleBob BuffPants'? He's in there! [points to inside of bar]
Sandy: Uhh, whatever. Thanks.
SpongeBob: [now inside]I start off with twenty raw eggs everyday. But that's just me.
Sandy: Pardon me.
SpongeBob: Working out is my life! I remember when I used to look like that guy over there. [points to weak fish]
Fish: Who me? [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: I remember when I used to look like you, too. [points to Larry and laughs] But, that was a long time ago.
Bartender: Here's your drink, sir.
SpongeBob: Thank you. [tries to lift up drink but can't so he stretches his mouth out to the straw and drinks] Yeah...
Sandy: SpongeBob? Wha-where'd you get those muscles?
SpongeBob: I've created my own workout routine that's given me amazing results. [anchor arm almost slips off] Whoops! Yeah, I have never felt better.
Sandy: Heck, what's your secret?
SpongeBob: What?
Sandy: Your secret workout. What is it? [everyone wants to know and looks over at SpongeBob. SpongeBob thinks of something nervously and quickly.]
SpongeBob: Hmmm, well... I, uhh... first I take my hand and I do this... [makes armpit noises]
Larry: Are you kidding?
SpongeBob: Do these muscles lie? [flexes muscles into a shape of a sponge. Everyone starts making armpit noises]
Sandy: I'm glad to see you found an exercise program that works for you.
SpongeBob: Yeah, your workout routine wasn't quite tough enough for me.
Sandy: Can't argue with those results. What you need to do now is put those muscles to the test.
SpongeBob: Uhh, what do you mean?
Sandy: The big Mussel Beach anchor tossing competition. It's today! Everybody'll be there!
Bartender: Here's your drink. [sets drink on SpongeBob's anchor-arm hand and it sinks down]
Sandy: Hey, with those arms, you'll do great!
SpongeBob: Uhh, well, I'm not sure.
Sandy: C'mon, let's go.
SpongeBob: Right now? Wait, uhh, wait, Sandy. I don't think it's such a... [tries to run away but the drink is holding him back. Tries lifting the drink but is unsuccessful] Sandy, wait!
Sandy: Here it is-- the sign-in list.
SpongeBob: Oh, no.
Sandy: [signs her name on a piece of paper] Okay, Sandy Cheeks. [puts the paper into entry box]
SpongeBob: [still struggling] Wait, Sandy-- don't sign just yet!
Sandy: [Puts the paper in the box]
SpongeBob: Wait!
Sandy: Okay...
SpongeBob: [struggles even harder] Wait!
Sandy: [signs names] SpongeBob SquarePants. [the bartender lifts the drink off of SpongeBob, which sends him flying towards Sandy]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait...! [slams into pole]
Sandy: It's okay, SpongeBob, I already signed your name in.
SpongeBob: Oh, great. Thanks, Sandy. [at the competition]
Announcer: We on? Welcome to the Goo Lagoon 8th annual anchor toss competition. [everyone is getting ready but SpongeBob is nervous]
Sandy: Ready, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, yeah. Great. No problem. [blows frantically into his Anchor Arms]
Announcer: Could I get some mustard on that? Oh. First up, Don the Whale. [Don throws the anchor and it lands. Fish comes up to measure distance]
Measurer: 200 yards. [crowd cheers]
Announcer: Let's see an instant-replay. [another anchor comes flying in on top of the measurer and hits him.] Amazing! Up next, Larry the Lobster. [Larry throws his anchor and it follows the measurer wherever he goes]
Measurer: 210 yards!
Announcer: Here goes, Sandy Cheeks. [Sandy throws it up in the air and kicks it away. Measurer runs around until he gets hit]
Measurer: 510 yards!
Announcer: Wow! Fabulous!
Sandy: Beat that, SpongeBob!
Announcer: Up next, SpongeBob SquarePants.
Crowd: [crowd is imitating the armpit exercise while others are holding up SpongeBob signs and chanting] SpongeBob! SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tries to pull the anchor but instead he falls under the ground with the anchor and comes out and laughs] Just kidding. Just kidding. [everyone laughs]
Sandy: That SpongeBob is funnier than ears on an acorn.
SpongeBob: Oh, this is it. They're all gonna find out I'm a fake. I can't give up. I've got to try. I can do it! I've got Anchor Arms! I'm no wimp, I'm a jerk!
[He blows his Anchor Arms over the "JERK" size. Tries to lift the anchor again but when he tries too hard, some of the air in one arm goes into SpongeBob's nose. Tries to lift again, but the air goes into his left eye as the crowd 'ooh's. Tries to lift again and causes the air to go into his left tooth. Tries to lift again the last time, causing the Anchor Arms to burst around his body, then explode. After the air blows off, the popped Anchor Arms deflate, floating down. SpongeBob then reveals his real arms hidden from inside his body.]
Crowd Attendee: I think he lost. [crowd chants for Sandy] Sandy! Sandy! Sandy! [Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and taps her foot, disappointed. SpongeBob walks away, leaving his destroyed Anchor Arms on the ground and follows Sandy to the Treedome]
SpongeBob: 96. 97. 98. 99. 100.
Sandy: I want 100 more.
SpongeBob: It hurts. [changes channel over and over] 1. 2. 3. 4...
Sandy: I think we finally found an exercise for you, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: ...9. 10. [his arm falls off] Can you get that?
Squidward: [talking to a wax sculpture of himself] Have I told you how beautiful you are? Your tentacles, your nose, your eyes...a little lopsided. [takes out the right eye, fixes it then puts it back in place] There. And now that I've been immortalized in wax, I have conquered all artistic media. Come on, my precious reflection, smile! [Squidward makes wax sculpture smile. Then he hears a crash from outside and frowns; the sculpture does as well]
SpongeBob: Hike, Patrick, hike! [both run in separate directions but SpongeBob has a big rock. Drops the rock on the ground and it breaks in half while Patrick blows a chess piece across a chessboard] You just lost three points. [climbs a tree branch] One. Two. Five! [flips upside down and blows a bubble into a shape] G-7!
Patrick: G-7? King me! King me! [runs into the coral branch and pops the bubble] I lose!
SpongeBob: But it's not Tuesday, Patrick.
Patrick: Tartar sauce! [Squidward peeks out]
Squidward: Hey! What are you invertebrates doing?
SpongeBob & Patrick: We don't know.
Squidward: Hey, Patrick, do you know what time it is?
Patrick: Uh, yeah, Squidward, it's... [checks his watch but all the bubble soap leaks out when he turns his wrist around]
Squidward: Time to find some other game to play! [laughs. Turns on the record player while taking a bubble bath]
SpongeBob: Now what?
Patrick: [notices a shell on the ground] We could toss that shell back and forth.
SpongeBob: [picks up shell] Okay... ready! [throws shell into Patrick's belly. Patrick shoots it into the air]
Patrick: Go! [SpongeBob goes after it]
SpongeBob: I got it! I got it! [the shell flies through Squid's open window, knocks into Squid's sculpture, and it falls over] I got it! I got it! I got it! [Squid in the other room, hears a thump, but he ignores it. Sponge and Pat enter the room via the elevator] Remember, Patrick, finders keepers.
Patrick: There it is! [points to the shell that is in the wax sculpture of Squidward]
SpongeBob & Patrick: I got it! I got it! [Patrick pulls the shell out]
Patrick: Bonus points! [Patrick starts to walk off]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick? I think something's wrong with Squidward. He looks unconscious.
Patrick: Don't worry. I know how to do this. [Patrick tries to give CPR, but his face turns blue and he floats up to the ceiling but lets out all the air and lands on top of the wax sculpture's head]
SpongeBob: Get off him, Patrick! [Patrick stands up]
Patrick: What are you worried about? [Patrick's butt is now imprinted on the sculpture's face] He looks better already. [SpongeBob & Patrick stand him up]
SpongeBob: But he still feels cold.
Patrick: Well, let's go put him in the warm. [they bring the sculpture in front of the window with the sun shining through it]
SpongeBob: Do you think he'll be okay?
Patrick: You know, you worry too much. [the sculpture begins to melt] The Patrick is here and SpongeBob I know a lot about head injuries, believe... [starts to drool as SpongeBob snaps his fingers] ...me. Hey, what's that on your shoe? [SpongeBob looks down]
SpongeBob: I don't know.
Patrick: It kind of looks like... [a liquid puddle of green goo is on the floor]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Squidward! [both are screaming as Squidward is powdering his nose]
SpongeBob: No, no, that part goes here.
Patrick: Yeah-yeah, that's it, uh-huh.
SpongeBob: We're almost there. We can do this.
Patrick: It's working, it's working...
SpongeBob: This is working. [sculpture melts again] Patrick, this isn't working!
Patrick: Look! [eyes turn over]
SpongeBob: I don't know how to say it, but our old pal Squidward, he's... He's... He's pushing up daisies!
Patrick: Oh, I thought he was dead. [Squidward comes out of the bathroom covered in talcum powder. SpongeBob & Patrick cling to each other and get scared]
Squidward: [screams] What are you doing here?! Well? Are you two trying to say something, or do I have to...?
SpongeBob: No, stay back!
Squidward: What is the matter with you two?
Patrick: Don't, don't hurt us!
SpongeBob: It was an accident!
Squidward: What are you two talking about? [he notices the goo on the floor and screams] Look what you've done to me! When I get my hands on you, I'll...
SpongeBob: Please, Mr. Squidward's ghost! [SpongeBob & Patrick are bowing before Squidward] Spare us your ghostly anger! [Patrick is kissing Squidward's feet]
Patrick: Oh, yes, Mr. Squidward's ghost! Please don't haunt us!
SpongeBob: We'll do anything you want! Just have mercy on us! [Squidward then gets an idea and grins evilly]
Squidward: Enough! Listen up, Squidward's ghost is feeling unusually generous today. He hath decided to spare ye a horrible fate. All ye must do is tend to my every whim and tickle my fancy on demand.
SpongeBob: Does that include...
Squidward: Quiet! Now, do as you're told! Lest ye incur the wrath of Squidward!
Patrick: [whispers to SpongeBob] I think they make a cream for that now. [SpongeBob and Patrick carry out Squidward on his bed]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Too hot. [walk a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: No, too wet. Keep going. Keep going. [walks a little more then stops]
SpongeBob: Here?
Squidward: Toulouse-Lautrec. [rim shot]
SpongeBob: Too tired... [both stop where they are]
Squidward: Perfect. Hmmm, I feel needy. [claps his hands] Slaves, fetcheth me some nourishment.
SpongeBob: Only the freshest, o spooky one. [both run off. SpongeBob comes back with grapes] A grape fresh from the vine, your ghostliness. [Squidward eats it while SpongeBob goes and gets a banana] A banana peeled to your liking, your incorporealness. [squeezes it into Squidward's mouth. Patrick comes back with a watermelon]
Patrick: One watermelon... [drops it into Squidward's mouth, who keels over due to the weight] Fresh from the manure fields, your spookiness. [on the ground, Squidward's head is shaped like the watermelon]
SpongeBob: Art thou not pleased? [Squidward spits out the watermelon]
Squidward : Enough of that! I want something else to eat now. Something that's very difficult to find.
Patrick : What do you hunger for, master?
SpongeBob: Whatever you want, we'll find it. We'll find it.
Squidward: Cherry pie. [Patrick holds up a cherry pie] Where'd you get that?
Patrick: I found it. [Squidward takes it and throws it somewhere]
Squidward: Well, go find it again! [Patrick goes searching for it] SpongeBob, get over here. Now spin around. [SpongeBob turns around] That's better. Now jog in place. [SpongeBob jogs in place] Say "flank steak".
SpongeBob: Flank steak.
Squidward: I think I'm beginning to like this. Stop. [SpongeBob stops] Now, play me an elaborate song with this! [gives SpongeBob a tissue]
SpongeBob: But this is just a piece of tissue paper.
Squidward: Oh, my. Always having to have it our way, don't we? Oh, boo-hoo. [SpongeBob blows through the tissue to try and get it to make music]
SpongeBob: I can't do it!
Squidward: Well, I hope you don't have any plans tonight, 'cause you're not allowed to leave that spot till I hear a song. [walks away. Day turns into night and into day again and SpongeBob is lying on the ground with the tissue on his nose] What's this? Napping on the job? You're supposed to be making music for me. As punishment for this insolence, Squidward's ghost commandeth you to clean out his back room.
Patrick: [comes back with the pie] I found it. [Squidward takes it]
Squidward: I'll take that! [throws pie in Patrick's face]
Patrick: Yes, your ghostliness! [licks filling off his face] This is fun.
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you ready for this?
Patrick: Yes. [SpongeBob walks a couple steps forward]
SpongeBob: Okay, let's go. Patrick, are you coming? [Patrick is facing the wrong way]
Patrick: Yes.
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's this way.
Patrick: Where?
SpongeBob: Here.
Patrick: [turns around] Oh, coming! [both enter a room in the back with a bunch of junk in it] How are we going to clean up all this mess?
SpongeBob: It's easy. Just tear this wallpaper off! [tears the wall]
Patrick: [laughs] Oh look, you missed some. [SpongeBob picks up a book]
SpongeBob: Oh, let's see. It's a comic book, and look at this. It's the Origin of the Flying Dutchman. [shows picture in the book] It says when he died they used his body as a window display. Now he haunts the seven seas because he was never put to rest. Well, don't you get it, Patrick?
Patrick: We're going to go shopping?
SpongeBob: No! We're gonna put poor old Squidward to rest. [Squidward is laying on the couch, SpongeBob & Patrick spit spitballs at him]
Squidward: Ow! What the heck was that?
SpongeBob: Initiation! That was part one of your ceremony.
Squidward: Ceremony for what?
SpongeBob: We're going to put you to rest.
Squidward: I don't want to be put to rest! All I want are those chores done. Now, did you clean the back room yet?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Squidward: Oh, really? I'm going to go check. [walks off. Opens door and screams because he sees Patrick & SpongeBob with a coffin]
SpongeBob: Okay, get in.
Squidward: Are you crazy? I'm not getting in that thing!
SpongeBob: But you said we could put you to rest.
Squidward: I didn't say anything like that! Now, get out of my house!
[Squidward pushes SpongeBob and Patrick outside ]
Squidward: Now what? [Squidward sees SpongeBob writing on a tombstone]
SpongeBob: I wrote "Here lies Squidward. You may not remember him, but..." [Squidward screams] Oh, hi, Squidward. Does this look deep enough?
Squidward: SpongeBob! Cut that out!
SpongeBob: Oh, look, the mourners have arrived. [a bus with a load of people are in front of Squidward's house]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward, we all came as soon as we were sure you were dead.
Squidward: SpongeBob, are you trying to put me in the nuthouse?
SpongeBob: No, just into this hole.
Squidward: [Groans then sighs] SpongeBob, I have a confession to make. [Takes off his night cap]
SpongeBob: [gasps] You're bald?
Squidward : No, I'm not bald! I'm alive! Now get rid of that tombstone and tell all your friends to go home!
SpongeBob: But-
Squidward: Do it!
SpongeBob: Go home. [People get back on bus sadly] But I, Master--
Squidward: I'm not your master, I'm your neighbor. Now do me a favor and stop doing me favors! [walks off]
SpongeBob: As you wish, master.
Squidward: D'oh!
Patrick: Boy, he really had us fooled.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's the fool. He's a ghost in denial. He needs us now more than ever.
Patrick: You're right. He really needs to get up to the great beyond.
SpongeBob: Patrick, say that again.
Patrick: That again?
SpongeBob: No, the other thing.
Patrick: No, the other thing.
SpongeBob: [annoyed] No, what you said before when you...
Patrick: No, what you said before when you...
SpongeBob: Never mind! I've got an idea.
Patrick: Never mind! I've got an idea. [SpongeBob gets annoyed again. Later, Squidward is reclining on his chair outside. SpongeBob is trying to blow a bubble big enough to get Squidward]
SpongeBob: I can't reach him!
Patrick: Blow harder! [SpongeBob blows a big bubble to consume Squidward. The bubble lifts Squidward gently from his chair. The octopus doesn't notice that he's floating.] There he goes!
SpongeBob: Isn't he beautiful?
Patrick: How high's he going to go? [Squidward sees he's floating]
SpongeBob: All the way, Patrick, up to the great beyond. [both of them wave to Squidward] Goodbye, friend!
Patrick: Happy trails! [Squidward pounds his fists on the bubble and tries to yell, but his voice is so distorted by the soapy wall that unintelligible muffled noises come through.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: He's on the other side now.
Patrick: Yeah. [Squidward is floating above the sea at Bikini Atoll island in a bubble] He's in a better place. [Squidward moans in the bubble with seagulls flying around him]
[At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is sniffing a Krabby Patty, then squirts a mustard "checkmark" on the patty and puts on the bun. Just then, SpongeBob hears Pearl come in crying. SpongeBob gets a pan and puts it on top of his head for protection from the tears]
Mr. Krabs: Don't cry, love. Daddy's going to make it all right. Calm down, girl! [a wave of water from the tears busts the door down, but SpongeBob pushes the door back up for a couple seconds, then the water comes breaking through the door and wipes out all the customers, dropping them to the floor. SpongeBob walks up to Mr. Krabs with part of a table around his face]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, what's wrong with Pearl?
Mr. Krabs: Her scurvy prom date stood her up, boy, and now, she can't seem to find another.
Pearl: That's because there's only one fish in the sea that's long, tan and handsome as he is. And that's him!
Mr. Krabs: No, no, baby, no more crying. We'll get you a date. Why, uhh... I'll take ya! [Pearl begins to cry and an earthquake starts] Well, what about Squidward? [Squidward is filing his tentacles. Pearl cries even harder and makes the earthquake even worse]
Mr. Krabs: Wait, wait. Here, take SpongeBob!
Pearl: Ahh! the fry cook? Do you know what that would do to my complexion? People would mistake me for a planetarium.
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean?
Pearl: I don't know. But I can't take him, daddy! They'll kick me off the most frequently pictured in the yearbook committee.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, they would. We've got to find someone else. Listen up! Which one of you lucky lubbers wants to take me lovely daughter Pearl to the prom? [everyone runs away]
Pearl: Just don't be late, SpongeBob. [walks off]
Mr. Krabs: Now listen, boy, I'm-a counting on you to make this a very special night for a very special girl. Remember, you're doing it for good old Mr... [the real SpongeBob walks up behind him]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Mr. Krabs! Are you talking to that dummy I made? It's pretty realistic isn't it? [holds up the left arm] I made this part out of...
Mr. Krabs: Never mind that, boy! You're taking Pearl to her prom!
SpongeBob: Really? Oh, wow! Don't worry, Mr. Krabs, I am a prom expert! [now at home] Oh, Gary, I'm a prom failure. I couldn't even get a date for my own junior prom.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, that was Patrick who brought his mom. Besides, how am I supposed to compare with Pearl's old boyfriend, Mr. Long, Tan and Handsome?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What is it, Gary? What do you have? [Gary hides in his shell while SpongeBob takes out a magazine from Gary's shell. Magazine is 'Long Tan and Handsome'] Hey, Gary, this magazine gives me an idea! [SpongeBob cuts through some black fabric then sews it up. Then he takes a shower and plucks his eyebrows to put in some new ones. Then he plants some seeds into the tuxedo and waters it to grow a pink flower. Now, he ties his shoes which are on stilts] Long. [pops out of a toaster as some bread] Tan. [licks his two front teeth that are braced up] Handsome. Okay, Gary, wait ‘til Pearl gets an eyeful of this! [Gary hides in his shell. Later, SpongeBob's limo drives up to Mr. Krabs house. SpongeBob rings the door bell and Mr. Krabs opens the door]
Mr. Krabs: Hello? [SpongeBob lowers himself by some sort of crank] What do you think, Pearl? Cleans up pretty well, doesn't he?
Pearl: [wearing a pink dress] Well, at last no one will recognize you. Now listen, SpongeBob, I just want to get through this with my social status intact. [SpongeBob writes down a list of what Pearl wants to do on a notepad] I want to go to the prom, get my picture taken, and I want to dance... [SpongeBob has a big list now] ...I want to drink punch with my friends and don't do that other thing you're always doing...
SpongeBob: Uhh, Pearl, we've got to get back to the limo.
Pearl: [claps] A limo! Why didn't you say so? [Pearl grabs SpongeBob and drags him out of the house] I love limousines!
Mr. Krabs: Go easy on him, lassie! I can't afford to break in a new fry cook! [laughs and closes the door. Now at the prom where the limo is driving up, but the back wheels are flat so it is screeching on the road]
SpongeBob: [checks his list] Well, I guess the first thing we should do is... [flash goes off where the pictures are being held]
Pearl: Yay! My first prom picture!
SpongeBob: Uh-uh-uh... our first prom picture. [Pearl sprays him with something that deflates his arm]
Pearl: Let's get this over with. [SpongeBob is having trouble getting over to the photo-shoot] Come on, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Be right there.
Pearl: Will you hurry up?
SpongeBob: Just a second. Coming! [SpongeBob messes up his footing and jumps everywhere and apologizes to everyone but eventually gets to the photo-shoot. He holds onto the curtain to keep his balance] Sorry! Pardon me! Here I am...! Cheese...! [curtain collapses on them and the photo is taken] That'll be a keeper.
Judy: Hey, look, it's Pearl! Hi, Pearl!
Pearl: SpongeBob, here come my friends. Uhh, go get me some punch!
SpongeBob: Prom expert; away! [jumps away as Pearl's friends walk up to her]
Judy & Friend: Hi, Pearl!
Pearl: Hi, girls.
Judy: I'd like you to meet Billy Fishkins!
Billy: Meep.
Friend: And you know Brian Flounder from math class.
Brian: Meep.
Pearl: Hi Brian.
Friend: So, like, where's your date, Pearl? We're all dying to meet him.
Pearl: He's over at the punch bowl getting me some punch. [friend looks for SpongeBob]
Judy: Ohh, is he the really tall one?
Pearl: Oh, yes! [notices what SpongeBob is doing] I mean... Oh no. [SpongeBob is trying to reach for the spoon to get some punch, but can't reach because he is too tall, the spoon is alive. He misplaces his footing and gets the punch all over him. Pearl pushes her friends away] Oh, quick, let's go see how ugly Cindy's dress is! [SpongeBob hands two glasses of punch to some people] SpongeBob, what are you doing?! [SpongeBob has red skin now from the punch. He squeezes some juice from his nose and into the glass]
SpongeBob: Hi, Pearl! Come on, it won't bite!
Pearl: You look ridiculous! [gasps]
SpongeBob: What is it? [Pearl pushes him under the table]
Pearl: Get down, he'll see us! It's my ex-boyfriend, Octavius Rex, a.k.a. long, tan and handsome!
Octavius: Meep.
SpongeBob: Whoa. But, I bet he isn't holder of the Regional Romance Dance Championship trophy! [holds it up, but another guy takes it away because it's his]
Anchovy: Give me that back.
SpongeBob: [giggles] That just didn't happen. Let's go! [takes Pearl to the dance floor] Ready? [dances like crazy]
Pearl: SpongeBob, what are you doing? Can't you see everybody here is doing 'the whack'? [the couples are jumping at each other with their chests. We see couples jumping up and hitting each other]
SpongeBob: The whack? Oh, yeah, I invented that one. [tries to jump]
Pearl: Are you sure you can do this? [SpongeBob jumps at Pearl, but they hit another couple and send them flying through the food table, shattering food and kitchenware. One of the people crash through a fruit painting]
Painter: Aaah! a monster! [jumps into a trash can which makes everyone else scream and go crazy]
Pearl: Well, I guess you can take me home now, now that you've ruined everything! [cries]
SpongeBob: Don't cry, the prom expert is here! I haven't failed yet! [looks through the list he wrote down] Hey, we can still... no, I broke that. We could... no. Don't cry! D-d-don't cry. [At this point, SpongeBob seems to be talking to himself more than he is to Pearl.] Whatever you do, don't... [cries, runs off]
Judy: Wow, what did you do to him? Poor little guy... [SpongeBob runs into the ladie’s bathroom. A couple girls run off screaming]
Pearl: [walks up outside the ladies restroom] Sponge, are you okay?
SpongeBob: [crying] — Messed everything up.
Pearl: Don't worry, SpongeBob, ya didn't mess everything up.
SpongeBob: [crying] — Hot dog!
Pearl: Actually, it was pretty funny when that hot dog landed in Judy's hair.
SpongeBob: [crying] All I wanted was to have a good time!
Pearl: But I am having a good time! Ya know, we haven't finished our dance yet.
SpongeBob: [whimpers] Can I still wear the wig?
Pearl: Yes, you can still wear the wig. [SpongeBob runs out and grabs Pearl to the dance floor]
SpongeBob: Let's go!
♪All right, you invertebrates. I'm gonna teach you how to do The Sponge. Well, first you take your leg and you stick it in the air, And then you take the other one and jam it right up there, You twist yourself around and give a great big lunge, Now you're doin' The Sponge. Huh, do The Sponge, Sponge, oh do The Sponge, Beat your buns you're doin' The Sponge. Well, now, first you take your leg And you stick it in the air, And then you take the other one, And you jam it right up there, You twist yourself around And you give a great big lunge, Now you're doin', yeah, now you're doin' The Sponge.♪
Pearl: [Octavius Rex walks up to Pearl] Get lost, pizza topping! Can't you see I'm doing the Sponge? [People are still breaking stuff and running around screaming, an old lady is tied up with two men, two men crash into themselves, their heads are upside down as the paramedics run out carrying people out on their stretcher Some are hurt and crying. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Pearl are still dancing. Pearl takes SpongeBob and wraps him into a basketball. Shoots and the word "score" lights up on the scoreboard. Angry people from the prom pick up both SpongeBob and Pearl and carry them over to the door]
Angry crowd: Get out!
SpongeBob & Pearl: They love us! Yay, we're popular! [Both thrown out of the gym]
Angry crowd: And don't come back!
Long, tan and handsome Anchovy leader: Go wreck someone else's prom, will ya? [Goes back inside gym. Later, SpongeBob and Pearl walking up to her house]
SpongeBob: Gee whiz, Pearl. I'm sorry tonight didn't go out like you planned.
Pearl: Oh, don't worry, SpongeBob, I knew it would be a total disaster all along. But as long as disasters go, that was really fun. [Mr. Krabs opens up the door]
Mr. Krabs: A-ha! Keep away from me precious little flower! [Pearl gasps] You almost stepped on it. [rakes the flower in the ground. SpongeBob froze in his spot]
Pearl: Oh, daddy! Well, good night, short, yellow and spongy. SpongeBob? [shrugs her shoulders and walks back inside]
Mr. Krabs: Good job, laddie. [winks at him and goes back inside. The real SpongeBob appears from the side]
SpongeBob: Ah, there you are, dummy! You sure come in handy! [laughs].
SpongeBob: Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward. Hey Squidward.
Squidward: All right, I'll bite. What is it, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Do you know what today is?
Squidward: Annoy Squidward Day?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, silly! [gets out a calendar] That's on the 15th! [day is marked by a picture of Squidward's head] Today is the beginning of the judging for Employee of the Month.
Squidward: SpongeBob, don't you know that award's a scam?
SpongeBob: What do you mean?
Squidward: Mr. Krabs gives you that award so you'll work harder for no extra money.
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. He gives it to me because I work harder. You could win it too, if you tried harder.
Squidward: Oh, for what? To get my face on the Wall of Shame? [shows wall full of SpongeBob pictures for being Employee of the Month]
SpongeBob: Squidward, you've got it all wrong. Having pride in your work is nothing to be ashamed of, why it's the only thing that makes it all worthwhile.
Mr. Krabs: Thattaboy, SpongeBob! This is going to be a tough one though! There's no clear cut winner! [whispering] Watch out, SpongeBob. Squidward appears to be on the verge of a breakout. [shows Squidward reading a magazine] There might be a new face on the wall this month.
SpongeBob: Huh? [looks over and sees the month of "January" with no picture]
Squidward: That's right, SpongeBob. I might sneak up on you. [Squidward and Mr. Krabs laugh at SpongeBob as he walks over to the wall and imagines Squidward laughing at him in the picture]
SpongeBob: Nooo! [begins to sob] How could I have let the quality of my work slip so much?! [Squidward's picture continues to laugh. Scene goes to SpongeBob grilling and flipping patties until he comes to a patty that won't flip. He tries and tries, but then he flips the patty on to the ceiling. He then tries to get it off of there.]
Squidward: [peeks in] Need some help? [SpongeBob screams] What are you doing?
SpongeBob: Making...Krabby Patties?
Squidward: You're losing it! Don't you know that award is a load of-- [SpongeBob gets the patty off the ceiling, but he flings it into the fan and it sprays Squidward with all the meat] ...garbage.
SpongeBob: [jumps off of ceiling] Please don't tell Mr. Krabs about this! It'll hurt my chances of winning the award!
Squidward: I already told you, that award is a bunch of... [gets sprayed with meat again] ...baloney!
SpongeBob: That is not true, Squidward. Like this hat, that award is a symbol of...
Squidward: [grabs SpongeBob's hat] It's a symbol that you're a chump! [SpongeBob screams, feeling scared]
SpongeBob: No, Squidward! [screams]
Squidward: And this is a symbol of what I think of the 'Employee of the Month' award! [Squidward lifts his foot and tries to stomp the hat flat, but his foot hits something that is under the hat, and he screams in pain. SpongeBob lifts up the hat to reveal a stick of lead underneath]
SpongeBob: An experienced employee of the month always keeps a brick of lead in his hat.
Squidward: I'm telling you for the last time, that award is nothing but a joke! [Squidward walks away, but is sprayed with meat for the last time. Then we see SpongeBob looking at all his award photos]
SpongeBob: What if Squidward's right? What if the award is a phony? Does this mean my whole body of work is meaningless?! [every award photo now has an army hat on]
SpongeBob Picture: Stow that kind of talk, sailor! This is war now, private! That's exactly what he wants you to think! This is no time to go lily-livered on us!
SpongeBob: But, sir…
SpongeBob Picture: There's no room for "buts" in war, soldier! He wants you to crack! He's trying to trick you, get inside your mind! You will stop at nothing--and I mean nothing--to defeat him! Have I made myself clear, private?
SpongeBob: Crystal, sir!
SpongeBob Picture: Good! Now move out! [SpongeBob marches away and then we see SpongeBob looking through his windows through binoculars while Squidward gets ready for bed]
SpongeBob: I won't let Squidward win! [Squidward sets his alarm and walks off] He can't go to work if he doesn't wake up. Target sited. [SpongeBob sneaks up to Squidward's house by sliding on the ground then through one of Squidward's windows and as he enters he falls to the ground and Squidward's hears the noise while he is brushing his teeth. Squidward goes to check what it is and SpongeBob is standing behind the plant by the door. Squidward closes the door and SpongeBob slides around the door and then by Squidward's bed where the alarm clock is. He is about to grab it when he hears the door handle jiggle so he hides in the pillow on the bed. Squidward gets into bed and isn't comfortable with the pillow as it is so he adjusts it. Tries to adjust it again and you can hear SpongeBob's giggling. Squidward lays his head down and SpongeBob's hand reaches out for the clock and Squidward sees it. Squidward freaks out and throws the pillow against the wall. The cover comes down, revealing SpongeBob]
Squidward: SpongeBob? What are you doing here? [SpongeBob grabs alarm clock]
SpongeBob: You can't win that award if you don't get up for work! [SpongeBob destroys the clock. Squidward grabs another one and sets it on the stand. SpongeBob grabs that one and destroys it. Squidward opens up a closet full of alarm clocks. SpongeBob grabs a few clocks and destroys them one by one]
Squidward: Stop it, SpongeBob! If I really wanted that award, I could win it with my tentacles tied!
SpongeBob: [tosses the destroyed alarm clock over his shoulder] That can be arranged.
Squidward: You're a lunatic, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Maybe so, but I did win 'Employee of the Month' 26 months in a row.
Squidward: Are y-Are you trying to say that you are better than me?!
SpongeBob: I've been better than you 26 months--and it'll be 27 tomorrow.
Squidward: Oh, that's it, square-for-brains! That's it! I'm gonna show you how easy it is to win that award. I'm gonna be the new 'Employee of the Month'! I will prove to you that I am far more competent than you!
SpongeBob: Well, I'm going in early to wax the floors!
Squidward: Don't bother; I'll have done it already by the time you get there!
SpongeBob: Well, you'll have to get up pretty early to get there before me!
Squidward: I don't need to sleep! Loser!
SpongeBob: Well, me neither! …26-time loser! [SpongeBob and Squidward are watching each other through their windows] Look at him. Watchin' me.
Squidward: I'm watching you, SpongeBob. You're not leaving before me.
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, getting sleepy, huh?
Squidward: No, how about you?
SpongeBob: Nope! [Squidward gets out his clarinet and plays "Brahms' Lullaby". SpongeBob struggles to keep himself awake.] Nighty Night. [SpongeBob falls asleep and starts to snore. Later, Squidward tries to walk out, but falls into a very deep square hole right in front of his door]
Squidward: SpongeBob! [SpongeBob comes up with a shovel in his hand]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Going somewhere?
Squidward: I'm going to wring you dry when I get outta here! Now get me outta here!
SpongeBob: All right, Squidward. I'll stop by after work!
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob! [Squidward screams some more. SpongeBob walks back to bed]
SpongeBob: Now to get some rest. Don't wanna look tired for my 'Employee of the Month' photo! [SpongeBob goes to his bed and sleeps a while. Squidward manages to climb out of the hole; SpongeBob wakes up to hear some hammering] Squidward! [Squidward is nailing boards onto SpongeBob's front door]
Squidward: That oughta hold him! [SpongeBob saws around it and pushes the door on Squidward and runs away. A cage drops enclosing SpongeBob and Squidward laughs. SpongeBob slides out because he can fit through the bars]
Squidward: [walks along into a bottle and gets trapped] SpongeBob! Why, you little…! [SpongeBob writes "loser." on the bottle with his finger in a script writing and runs away. Later he sees a Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: Ha ha ha ha ha. Hmmm, a Krabby Patty! [smells it but the top bun opens up and a claw comes out grabbing SpongeBob's nose] Ow! Squidward!
Squidward: So long, Sponge loser! [Squidward gets caught in a net and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob runs through a barbed-wire fence and Squidward runs by laughing. Squidward is tied by his tentacles and SpongeBob runs by laughing. SpongeBob is stuck in a brick wall and Squidward runs by laughing. Later the two are trying to drag along some big items. SpongeBob is dragging an anchor and Squidward is dragging a flaming boat] SpongeBob? Truce? [both wave a white flag]
SpongeBob: Truce.
Squidward: SpongeBob, I can't take it anymore. If we keep this up, neither of us will win the award!
SpongeBob: You're right. We should save our energy for work where we really need it. [it’s now dawn]
Squidward: Okay, let's have a good clean fight.
SpongeBob: And may the better man win. [shakes hands with Squidward, now he's thinking] He's nothing but a lying, boneless, ink-squirting, big-nosed phony!
Squidward: [thinking] Look at that buck-toothed, corn-fed smile. You can't trust him as far as you can throw him.
SpongeBob: [thinking] As soon as he stops shaking my hand...
Squidward: [thinking] ...I'm gonna make a run for it.
[SpongeBob and Squidward stop shaking hands, laugh nervously, and hastily run for the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs is opening it up]
Mr. Krabs: Money, money, gonna make some money! [sees SpongeBob and Squidward come running over] Ah, it warms me wallet to see me employees coming in so early. Boys, you're early! [Mr. Krabs realizes that they aren't stopping for anything] Wait! [both push Mr. Krabs out of the way and start doing nice stuff]
SpongeBob: Look, Mr. Krabs! Clean floors!
Squidward: Clean tables, Mr. Krabs! [Squidward presses too hard on the table while he is cleaning and breaks it in half]
SpongeBob: Clean dishes, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What's going on here?! [SpongeBob drops and breaks the dishes and mops them just like that]
SpongeBob: It's much more efficient to clean dishes this way, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: No!
Squidward: Flowers and chocolate for you, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Look, I'm putting my own money in the register, Mr. Krabs! [SpongeBob puts his money into the register. Squidward and SpongeBob are in the kitchen] Two spatulas to increase productivity, Mr. Krabs! Faster, SpongeBob, faster!
Squidward: There's nothing to this patty flipping, Mr. Krabs! I'll easily double your output, SpongeHog!
Mr. Krabs: Boys, boys, boys! [music gradually speeds up; both SpongeBob and Squidward make many patties to overflow the kitchen, cornering Mr. Krabs] Help! Help! [the amount of Krabby Patties fills up the kitchen and the Krusty Krab itself, causing the whole restaurant to explode, sending thousands of patties raining down in front of the citizens]
Frank: Hey, free Krabby Patties!
Mr. Krabs: [with his head bursting through one of SpongeBob's employee pictures] Wait, you've got to pay for those! Wait! Wait! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! [SpongeBob and Squidward come through the picture frame that Mr. Krabs is in and ask him who is the winner, while Mr. Krabs is still complaining about the Krabby Patties]
SpongeBob: So, who's the winner of Employee of the Month?
Squidward: Me, me! It's me! [SpongeBob and Squidward continue calling out simultaneously about who is the winner]
Mr. Krabs: Boys! Wait! Boys, the Krabby Patties! Boys, wait!
Narrator: Halloween is no different under the waves. Pirates, skeletons, and sea monsters. [laughs evilly] Ohh, sorry. Everyone having fun. Well, almost everyone. [SpongeBob is washing the dishes in the Krusty Krab kitchen. The door creaks open and SpongeBob jumps in surprise]
SpongeBob: Huh? Who's there? [door creaks open some more as SpongeBob goes back to washing some dishes. Turns around and three pieces of paper spelling out "boo" turn on the ordering turntable. SpongeBob speeds up the cleaning of the dishes until he finishes]
SpongeBob: Okay, Mr. Krabs, the dishes are done, I'm leaving! [tries running out, but Mr. Krabs stops him in his tracks]
Mr. Krabs: Hold on. Don't you want to hear my annual scary story?
SpongeBob: No thank you, Mr. Krabs. Uhh, does it have monsters in it?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, the worst monster of them all.
SpongeBob: Uhh... no. [opens the door then turns around] Is it a true story?
Mr. Krabs: True as the deep blue.
SpongeBob: Okay, maybe just a little.
Mr. Krabs: Have a seat, me boy. [runs while saying "hot, hot, hot when carrying the campfire" sits on a log. Mr. Krabs puts a campfire in the middle of them] Every year on Halloween night, the Flying Dutchman descends on Bikini Bottom, in a pirate ship, just like this. [holds up a Krabby Patty] Only bigger!
SpongeBob: Excuse me, did his ship look like a Krabby Patty?
Mr. Krabs: Like I was saying, the Flying Dutchman swoops down and starts stealing people's souls. [holds up a pickle]
SpongeBob: Do souls look like pickles?
Mr. Krabs: Aye, as a matter of fact, they do. And he puts them where you can never get them... in his soul bag. [drops the pickle into a bag that has the words "Krusty Krab" crossed out and the word "soul" written above it. Mr. Krabs laughs evilly as Squidward appears behind SpongeBob in a pirate suit]
Squidward: I've come for your pickle. [SpongeBob jumps up screaming]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, Scaredy Pants gets easier to scare every year! [Squidward takes his costume off as SpongeBob, in a barrel, sees the pirate was Squidward]
SpongeBob: Humph, Squidward!
Mr. Krabs: Nothing like a good ghost story, eh, me boy? Hope you're not too scared to come to me party tonight, SpongeBob ScaredyPants! [laughs while walking out]
Squidward: [walks up behind SpongeBob] Steal your soul. [SpongeBob jumps out of the Krusty Krab screaming and beings to walk home. As he is walking home, he sees a jack-o-lantern and then he walks up to a kid in a cowboy costume]
Kid: Twick-ow-tweat! [SpongeBob screams and runs away. The kid’s parents walk up next to their son]
Mother: It's okay, son. That's just SpongeBob ScaredyPants. [SpongeBob is walking home until Mrs. Puff drives up and honks the horn, sending SpongeBob screaming and jumping to hold onto the street light]
Mrs. Puff: Happy Halloween, ScaredyPants. [drives off laughing]
SpongeBob: The name's SquarePants. It's SquarePants! [Cut later at his house, inside a pumpkin. SpongeBob and Gary are inside of it] I don't get it, Gary. Every Halloween, no matter how hard I try, everybody scares me.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [carves his pumpkin from the inside] Well, I'm sick of it. [SpongeBob comes out] No more ScaredyPants! [notices his pumpkin and screams while running into his closet]
Patrick: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Gary, it's Patrick! I'm going to scare him! It's my turn. [opens the door and tries to scare Patrick] Rawr! [Patrick has some funny glasses on]
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams. Patrick takes his glasses off] Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
SpongeBob: Why can't I be frightening for once? Where's my chance?
Patrick: Well, if you want to be scary, you got to need a good costume. [later, SpongeBob walks out of his closet with a big, white sheet on]
SpongeBob: What do you think?
Patrick: Great! You're going as my trick-or-treat bag!
SpongeBob: No, no! I'm the ghost of the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Uhh... something's missing. I know! [Patrick runs inside SpongeBob's closet. A tree falls down but then gets sawed down by Patrick. Patrick comes out with a pair of clogs] Step into these babies, Hans. [SpongeBob steps into the clogs] Terrifying.
SpongeBob: I don't know, Patrick. [doorbell rings]
Patrick: Come on, SpongeBob. It's little kids! Little kids are easy to scare! [door opens]
Kids: Trick-or-treat!
SpongeBob: [jumps out and tries to scare the kids like he did Patrick] Rawr-rawr! [kids laugh]
Kid #1: Look, it's the haunted mattress!
SpongeBob: Okay, okay, here's your candy.
Kid #1: No, please, that was enough of a treat, thank you. [kids walk away laughing]
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick.
Patrick: SpongeBob, look at my new paper ghost! [Patrick holds scissors in his right hand a has a puppet on his left hand] Oooh, scary.
SpongeBob: That is it, Patrick!
Patrick: What's it?
SpongeBob: What's the difference between that ghost and me? [Patrick concentrates]
Patrick: No, no, no wait. Don't tell me. [concentrates more] D-don't tell me. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! I can do this. Don't tell me! Don't tell me! Okay, tell me.
SpongeBob: I have a square head and a real ghost has a round one. All we have to do is make my head round and boo, I'm scary! [SpongeBob is now sitting on a chair in his bathroom. Patrick has goggles on]
Patrick: Okay, are you ready?
SpongeBob: [shows paper ghost] Remember, like this. [Patrick razors off SpongeBob's sides]
Patrick: Are you sure you want to do this?
SpongeBob: Shave me down, make me round! [Patrick razors off more and uses one piece to wipe off his sweat from his forehead]
Patrick: All right, let's get to it. [razors off more part. Later, SpongeBob is a round ghost]
SpongeBob: What do you think?
Patrick: Perfect. Now that's scary! [Patrick puts on his funny glasses] Let's go scare somebody. [SpongeBob runs down a street trying to scare people]
SpongeBob: Oooh... I'm the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Oooh... I don't know who I am! [man opens door]
SpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman!
Patrick: Oooh, I'm the Flying Dutchman's best friend! [both run off laughing]
Man: Hey, don't you kids want your candy? [both jump behind some coral in the shape of a skeleton head]
Patrick: Oh, boy, that was something. Your costume really packs a punch.
SpongeBob: Do you think?
Patrick: Oh, no question! You scared the barnacles off that guy!
SpongeBob: Who should we scare next?
Patrick: There's a whole party just full of people at the Krusty Krab and the Flying Dutchman is going to be show up uninvited! [kids laughing] Here comes someone now! [SpongeBob jumps out to scare the kids from earlier]
SpongeBob: Rawr! Rawr! I'm the Flying Dutchman! [SpongeBob & Patrick run off laughing again]
Kid #2: Wasn't that the Haunted Mattress?
Kid #3: I guess he's been demoted to a haunted sleeping bag! [kids laugh.]
[Later, Mr. Krabs is bobbing for apples with his daughter Pearl, who is dressed up as Frankenstein's bride. Mr. Krabs successfully bobs an apple, but accidentally swallows it. Mr. Krabs chokes on an apple]
Pearl: Oh, dad, you're embarrassing me again! [cries and runs off. Krabs spits out the apple which shoots past Squidward and Sandy]
Sandy: Howdy, Squidward, I mean, Flying Dutchman. Great party, huh?
Squidward: What are you supposed to be?
Sandy: Why, I'm a pet goldfish in a bowl!
Squidward: I don't get it. [SpongeBob and Patrick are on the roof of the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is tied up with some rope which Patrick will lower him in with. SpongeBob opens a door on the roof to peek through to look at the party]
Patrick: Are you ready, SpongeBob? [thumbs up from SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, kill the lights!
[lights go off. As soon as this happens, everybody begins panicking and running around screaming. SpongeBob is lowered in appearing with a scary look. Patrick begins talking through a megaphone to scare everyone. Mr. Krabs even hides in the apple barrel]
Patrick: Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I am the Flying Dutchman! Booga, booga, booga, booga! Give me your souls!
[a jellyfish zaps Patrick. He screams and lets the rope go plunging SpongeBob down onto the floor]
Patrick: Huh? [screams]
Kid #3: [notices SpongeBob's pants] Hey, that's no Dutchman, that's SpongeBob!
Sandy: SpongeBob?
Squidward: SpongeBob. [everyone laughs]
SpongeBob: [still dangling] Help! Help!
Patrick: [using megaphone] I am not SpongeBob. Those are my street clothes! [thunder appears and the front doors are open]
Flying Dutchman: Enough! [everyone gasps as green smoke comes into the Krusty Krab. A green figure appears]
Mr. Krabs: It's the real Flying Dutchman! [he faints]
Flying Dutchman: You bet your white lily livers I'm the Flying Dutchman. And I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. I'm going to steal your souls. [everyone screams] Quiet! [breathes out flames to burn them] You had it coming, you little crybabies. Every year, people dressing up like me. [Squidward takes his costume off and whistles nonchalantly] Turning the Flying Dutchman name in a laughingstock. But that's not the reason I'm taking your souls. [pointing at SpongeBob, who is hanging upside down] No, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. Out of all the Dutchman costumes I've seen, yours is the most insulting.
SpongeBob: Do you mean I'm not scary?
Flying Dutchman: You? Scary?! [cackles, then cuts the rope holding SpongeBob, and he falls to the floor] Let me tell you about scary, kid. There's all kinds of scary things in the world. Spiders are scary, uhh, I'm scary. You... you're not scary. Okay, let's get this over with. [flies back to the partygoers to steal their souls and evilly laughs in their faces which makes everyone scream in terror, one fish even shaking his head begging for mercy]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Flying Dutchman: First, I gotta get rid of this stupid costume. [takes off SpongeBob's ghost costume... then flies out screaming in terror. SpongeBob is now shown as skinless with just a brain, eyes, and a mouth with the lower half of his body]
SpongeBob: Hey, what do you know? I scared him! [laughs. Everyone else, except Patrick and himself, runs out screaming] It worked, Patrick. I scared everybody!
Patrick: Yeah, I guess it was your pink hat.
SpongeBob: Pink hat? Oh, that's not a hat. That's my brain.
Patrick: Oh. [runs away screaming. fade to black]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, it grows back!
SpongeBob: [Gary is on his exercise wheel] Exercise time is over, Gary. [takes Gary off his wheel] We don't want you getting too thin. [holds up a green, squishy ball] Here, boy. Fetch! [throws it and Gary goes after it but at a slow pace. SpongeBob checks his watch and goes sits on a chair and takes out the newspaper to read. Morning arrives and SpongeBob is asleep in the chair. Gary crawls up to SpongeBob and spits out the ball]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Huh? [sees the ball on the ground] Good job, Gary! [He jumps to Gary] I love you, Gary! [He starts scratching Gary and Gary purrs] Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary! [Gary climbs up on SpongeBob, purring and tickling him] Ha, ha! Down, boy! Ha ha! [Patrick comes through the door]
Patrick: SpongeBob! Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready?
SpongeBob: For what?
Patrick: The annual jellyfish convention in Ukulele Bottom this weekend! [shows his jellyfishing net off until he brakes something and blushes with embarrassment] So, you ready or what?
SpongeBob: That was this weekend? [He looks up at Gary who's still crawling all over him trying to tickle him] I can't go; I don't have anyone to take care of Gary!
[There's a knock on the door. Squidward is seen outside. The door opens, but the first thing Squidward sees is Gary on SpongeBob's head. He looks down at SpongeBob and reveals a pair of underwear.]
Squidward: Would you please stop leaving your undergarments on my front lawn?
SpongeBob: Squidward, could you watch Gary this weekend?
Squidward: What's a Gary?
SpongeBob: Not a Gary. Gary. He's my pet snail. [shows Gary to Squidward] Say hello! [Gary hisses at Squidward and drools]
Squidward: Yuck. You actually care for that thing?
SpongeBob: I love Gary!
Squidward: Well, I don't. Get somebody else. [walks off]
SpongeBob: I guess we can't go away this weekend after all, Patrick. [Squidward stops]
Squidward: Go away? [walks in reverse back to SpongeBob's Pineapple] You mean, if I watch Gary, you guys will be gone all weekend?
SpongeBob: Actually, a three day weekend.
Squidward: As in, not here for three days?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but you've already said you can't do it, we understand.
Patrick: Don't feel bad, Squidward. The three of us can still have our own jellyfish convention at your house!
Squidward: I changed my mind. You guys deserve a weekend away.
SpongeBob: You'll do it? Great! Let me show you a little bit about snail care. You need to take Gary for a walk.[SpongeBob explains the daily routine with Gary, but Squidward is busy thinking of how much fun he'll have with SpongeBob & Patrick away]
Squidward: Friday, Saturday and Sunday - a three-day weekend.
SpongeBob: Let me show you how to feed him. [opens a cabinet with six barrels of Gary's food] The cans are all marked, a can in the morning and a can at night.
Squidward: Sure it's enough? [bus drives up to the pineapple with other jellyfishers inside]
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Patrick: The bus is here! The bus is here! [crashes through the wall and through the bus leaving his starfish shape through each hole] C'mon, SpongeBob!
Group: Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing!
Squidward: [pushing SpongeBob out of the house] Well, time to go. Don't want to be late. Have fun, bye bye.
SpongeBob: Now, you won't forget my instructions, will you?
Squidward: I have the memory of an elephant, I'll take good care of Fred.
SpongeBob: Gary.
Squidward: Right, yeah, right. [bus drives off] Jellyfishing! Jellyfishing! So long, losers! [laughs with joy] They're gone! [runs inside his Easter Island Head. Gary peeks his eyes out the window]
Gary: Meow.
Squidward: [comes out with shorts on and his nose with sunscreen on it and a chair. Unfolds the chair and sits on it] This is going to be the best three days of my life. [sighs and lays back with a sun reflector in front of him] I'm going to do all the things I can't normally do because of SpongeBob. [The time card "3 Days Later" appears, and now Squidward is badly sunburned, The bus comes back as the group is chanting "jellyfishing"] Well, thus ends the greatest weekend of my life. No SpongeBob, no Patrick, nothing but me, me, me. [Squidward sees Gary through the window. Gary groans. Squidward's sunburn drains] [screams] The snail! I forgot the snail! [runs inside the pineapple where Gary is old and withered on the floor. Squidward takes him inside to the kitchen] I've got to do something. [takes all the barrels of food and puts it in his bowl] Okay, okay, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Right here. [throws the food at Gary trying to get him to eat it] [Gary lip syncing what Squidward's saying]: Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat! You've gotta finish this food!
SpongeBob: See you later, Patrick.
Squidward: Come on, eat! Eat! Eat! [SpongeBob gets his house key out. Squidward has to decide about the food] Ohh...
SpongeBob: [sticks the key in the hole and opens the door] Gary! I'm home!
Squidward: [greets SpongeBob with a head full of Gary's food that he ate] Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Squidward! What are you doing here? [Squidward swallows all the food]
Squidward: Oh, just checking up on old Gary for you.
SpongeBob: What a great friend you are, Squidward.
Squidward: So, uhh, well, see you. Goodbye.
SpongeBob: Thanks, Squidward. [Gary crawls to SpongeBob, still old and wrinkly] I can always count on you. [Gary moans and SpongeBob screams] Gary! Gary, what's happened to you? What's wrong? Squidward, something's wrong with Gary! Squidward! [Squidward frowns ‘cause he can't leave. Later, the doctors snail-mobile is in front of the pineapple]
Purple Doctorfish: Yes, yes, it's just as I thought.
SpongeBob: What?
Purple Doctorfish: This is definitely a snail.
SpongeBob: I knew it! Oh, Squid, did you hear that?
Purple Doctorfish: Therefore, a shot of snail plasma must be carefully administered. Here you go. [hands the shot to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Aren't you going to do it?
Purple Doctorfish: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm too squeamish. [doctor leaves. Squidward runs after him]
Squidward: Uhh, hey, doc, let me help you with your bag there.
SpongeBob: Squid, wait! I can't give Gary his plasma. I'm squeamish too.
Squidward: Aww, SpongeBob, I don't want to do... [Gary moans and coughs badly]
SpongeBob: Gary!
Squidward: Okay, okay, I'll do it. [takes the shot]
SpongeBob: Now, don't hurt him, Squidward. Okay, okay, steady. [Squidward tries to give Gary the shot but SpongeBob pulls him away] Wait, that's too hard. Okay, okay, okay, try it again. [Squidward keeps trying but gets the same result every time]
Squidward: Will you hold him still? [snail plasma shot in SpongeBob's nose]
SpongeBob: Ouch! Uh, Squidward, you just injected me with snail plasma.
Squidward: Well, you made me do it.
SpongeBob: What's going to happen to me?
Squidward: Oh, nothing, it's just a little snail plasma.
SpongeBob: I don't know, I feel kind of funny!
Squidward: I'm telling you, its all in your head. [Gary crawls to his water bowl to get a drink. After drinking the water, he gargles, clears his throat, and meows normally again.]
Squidward: He just needed water?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, you're better! [hugs him]
Squidward: Oh, how touching. I'm going to go home and throw up. Good night.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait, the snail plasma!
Squidward: Trust me, SpongeBob, nothing's going to happen to you. You're fine. [closes door]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Gary, Squidward says I'll be fine. He knows everything. So, you hungry?
Gary: [jumps up] Meow! [SpongeBob pours food into Gary's bowl, but decides to see what it tastes like. He likes it so he eats all of it. Then walks to Gary with the empty bowl]
SpongeBob: Here ya go. Eat up, Gary.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Gary, I couldn't control myself. [burps] Meow. Why did I just do that? Am I cracking up?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, no, Squidward's right. I'm fine. I- I worry too much. It's all in my head. I feel tip-top! [SpongeBob begins to walk out of the kitchen. His feet make loud pounding noises as they hit the floor, and he begins to go slower and slower. Soon Gary is going faster than he is.]
SpongeBob: Gary, you're getting a [voice slows, lowers] lot faster! [SpongeBob sluggishly walks into the bathroom, and Gary follows him. He looks in the mirror, and his voice echoes as he speaks.]
SpongeBob:  Look at me. Never better. [He yelps as dramatic music begins to play in the background. His head begins to throb, and his pores begin to grow and shrink, before returning to normal.] I'm okay! Squidward said I'm fine! [What he doesn't realize is that the worst is yet to come. His eyes bug out of his head, causing him to yell. The camera rotates around so we can get a side view of SpongeBob. He blinks, and his eyes briefly pop back into his head and return to normal. But this relief only lasts for about half a second. Then, his eyes bulge out even farther than before, and it looks very unnatural. They bulge for a while, and then they begin to transform, taking the shape and form of snail's eyes, with stalks. The sight causes SpongeBob's jaw to drop, and he screams louder. SpongeBob stares in the bathroom mirror at his brand-new eyestalks, which now have skin and eyelids around them. He turns to Gary.]
SpongeBob:  Gary... I'm fine! [But SpongeBob is not fine. Gary watches in horror as his owner falls onto his hands and knees, straining in pain.]
SpongeBob:  [in so much pain that he is barely comprehensible] Yyyyyy-yyyooooou'll see. [grunts and strains as his hand and arm slowly retract into his sleeve, which then pops off and bounces away] That's okay, I'm a lefty anyway! [Then, SpongeBob's feet and legs retract into his pants.]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously] Ha! Now I don't have to buy those new shoes! [his body shortens up like a snail and he screams] I take it back, Gary. Something is wrong with meeeee [he loses the ability to talk and completes his snail transformation] ow!
Squidward: [in his bed] I hope I never see another snail again. Good night, Clary. [a knock is heard on the door and the doorbell rings] Who could that be? As if I didn't already know. [Squidward walks to the door and opens it] SpongeBob, I already told you. You're gonna be just fi-i-i... [SpongeBob is a fully breaded snail now]
SpongeBob: Meow!
Squidward: [screams]
SpongeBob: Meow! Meow. [Squidward touches SpongeBob's left eye and it curls up]
Squidward: [screams and runs back inside shutting the door]
Squidward: SpongeBob? Oh, Neptune, what have I done? [picks up the snail plasma shot] It's all your fault. [throws it away] Okay, okay, okay, okay, get it together, Squidward.
SpongeBob: Meow! [Squidward screams and puts boards on his door. Turns around and SpongeBob is at his window] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams] Meow! [Squidward puts more boards on his window, but SpongeBob squeezes through the boards holes] Meow. Meow. [Squidward screams and runs into his closet]
Squidward: None of this would be happening if I'd only fed that snail! [SpongeBob squeezes in from under the door, and meows. Squidward screams and runs through his door, SpongeBob meows, Squidward runs up and down his ceiling while SpongeBob keeps meowing at him. Outside, his house is bouncing from side to side until it flipped on its side completely. Everything is broken and torn inside. Squidward sits up, but is injected with the snail plasma through his nose]
Squidward: Uh-oh! [now SpongeBob, Squidward, and Gary are on a fence singing "Blow the Man Down"]
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E♭] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [A♭], meow [G], meow [A♭], meow [F] .

Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E♭] .
Patrick: [opens his rock. He is wearing pajamas] Will you clam up?! [throws a boot]
SpongeBob: [Off-screen at the same time] Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [B♭], me- [C] Ommf! [boot knocks him off the fence]
Gary: Meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G], meow [E♭] .
SpongeBob: Meow [G], meow [B♭], meow [C], meow [B♭], meow [G] .
Squidward: Meow [B♭], meow [B♭], meow [B♭], meow [B♭], meow [A♭], meow [G], meow [A♭], meow [F], meow [E♭].. 
Voice: SB-129. [episode starts]
Narrator: Ahh, it is Sunday morning in Bikini Bottom, and it is about time for Squidward to practice his clarinet. So get your ear plugs ready.
Squidward: [kisses his clarinet] I think I'll treat Bikini Bottom to some real music. [He gets ready to play his clarinet, and then SpongeBob's alarm clock goes off, sending Squidward's clarinet into his throat] Yow! [Struggles to dislodge the clarinet out of his throat.]
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward! Wanna go jellyfishing? [Squidward tries to yell, but his clarinet sounds every time he tries to talk] Great! We'll be right over! [Squidward pulls the clarinet out of his throat. Door knocks are heard]
Squidward: I wonder who that could be. [Squidward opens the door]
SpongeBob: Ready to go?
Squidward: No, I'm not "ready to go!" [slams the door]
Patrick: He doesn't wanna play with us.
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, he's just not ready. [Squidward tries to play his clarinet, but he hears another knock at the door] Ready now?
Squidward: No! [slams door. Then he goes back to try to play clarinet is interrupted once again by yet another knock at door. Squidward gets angry]
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! [slams the door. The knock on the door is heard again] Huh? [opens door]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams the door. Another knock on the door and he opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: How about now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it]
SpongeBob: Now?
Squidward: No! [slams door, then opens it] No! [SpongeBob and Patrick are gone and they approach Squidward from behind. SpongeBob taps his shoulder] What?!
SpongeBob: Ready yet?
Squidward: No, I'm not ready! I'll never be ready! Don't you get it?!
SpongeBob: Sure we do.
Squidward: What? [stammers] D'oh...! [shuts the door and leaves his house, then realizes he's outside. He runs back to his door and knocks. SpongeBob opens it]
SpongeBob: Ready? [Squidward slaps his forehead, and then pushes SpongeBob and Patrick out of his house]
Squidward: OUT! Sheesh! Shouldn't you be at work today, SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: I'd love to be at work today! But it's Sunday; the Krusty Krab is closed. [Squidward gets an idea]
Squidward: Hold on a second. I'll be right out. [closes the door. Squidward tiptoes out the other way of his house to the Krusty Krab, and enters] Hello...? [silence] Ahh, alone at last. [tries to play his clarinet, but SpongeBob and Patrick are heard outside]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Squidward! Squidward? [Squidward runs into the kitchen as SpongeBob and Patrick come in the Krusty Krab and search for Squidward] Squidward! [Squidward runs into the freezer] Squidward? Oh, Squidward! [Squidward peeks out as SpongeBob and Patrick look for him] Squidward!
SpongeBob: Well, he's not here. I'll bet that eager-beaver's already down at Jellyfish Fields!
Squidward: A-ha! They're finally gone! [tries to open the freezer, but it's locked from the inside!] What the...? [tries to open it multiple times] Locked?! Oh no! Oh... well, someone will realize I'm gone and come looking for me. I'll be out of here in no time.
Narrator: 2,000 years later...
[the scene shows Squidward still inside the freezer, frozen; the hinges are rusty, and they fall off; the door falls with Squidward frozen behind it; SpongeTron flies past and then back to Squidward]
Sponge-Tron: Holy Krabby Patties! A frozen cephalopod! [Sponge-Tron grabs a chrome hammer; from the hammer comes a red laser, which melts the ice and hits Squidward's buttocks; Squidward screams]
Squidward: [trancelike] I'll be out of here in no time.
Sponge-Tron: Greetings, primitive.
Squidward: Sp...SpongeBob? Is that you?
Sponge-Tron: SpongeBob? No! [robot voice] I am Sponge-Tron. [normal voice] Welcome to the future!
Squidward: What?
Sponge-Tron: Welcome to the future!
Squidward: Uh, the future... [notices everything's chrome] Huh?! O-okay, uh, what's going on here? Why is everything... chrome?
Sponge-Tron: Everything is chrome in the future!
Squidward: Wha...? [stammers and runs to look outside a window] Oh, my... [notices the chrome environment. The screen pans around the chrome environment.] Impossible! He's lying! [A flower pops up from underground, then a truck comes, a fish gets out of the truck, runs up to the flower, sprays it with chrome spray paint, then runs back in the truck and drives away. Squidward looks at the screen.] He's right!
SpongeTron: Of course I'm right, Squidward! Just ask my clones: Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z. [Squidward flinches as a trio of Sponge-Tron clones have suddenly appeared next to them]
Squidward: Are the other letters of the alphabet involved here?
Sponge-Tron: Sure! All 486 of them! [Squidward does a few sit-ups while he talks as if he is trying to wake up]
Squidward: Future! Future! Future! Future! [SpongeTron drops a brick on Squidward's head] Thanks. NOW LISTEN! All of you! I don't belong here. This is all a horrible mistake! Please, we've got to do something!
Sponge-Trons X, Y, and Z: [pull out jellyfishing nets] Jellyfishing! [a two-headed Patrick appears out of nowhere]
Pat-Tron: Did somebody say, "jellyfishing"?
Sponge-Tron: Hi, Pat-Tron!
Squidward: J-just listen to me! I'm not supposed to be here! I've gotta get home to my own time period! I've gotta go!
Sponge-Tron: Well, why didn't you just ask? The time machine is down the hall, to the left. [Squidward runs to the door, laughs and enters, but the sound of a can-opener being used is heard. Squidward steps out and is torn into pieces, now appearing like a spring-shaped patch of skin] Oops! Oh, yeah, that one's the can opener... but try the one on the right. [Squidward tries the door on the right and enters a room that has a slot-looking machine that says "past" and "future"]
Squidward: Well, I wouldn't've chosen this interior... [notices time-travel handle] Oh, what's this? Well, if SpongeBob exists in the future, I'd better go to the past! [Squidward turns the key and puts the lever on "past." Siren goes off as time machine disappears from where it used to be in the Krusty Krab. Sponge-Tron waves at Squidward. The door and the wall fly through a hyperspace-like warp, then the time machine appears in a primitive Bikini Bottom.]
Squidward: [looks out and sees an Ammonite swim by. Whales calls can be heard] Wow, primitive. Has sort of an old-world charm. [a snake-like creature swims by really close to Squidward's face] Whoa! I guess this is before manners were invented! Well, at least there's no sign of SpongeBrat. Maybe now I can finally be alone with my clarinet. [hears a noise, turns around, but some shadow quickly hides. He hears another noise and checks again, but a different shadow hides] Huh? [one of the shadow figures swing from tree to tree] Huh? What?! [a shadow figure hides behind a tree] Huh!? [the other shadow figure hides behind a ledge. Squidward keeps walking and then notices a Prehistoric Sponge on the ground] SpongeBob? [Primate Sponge screams] Stay back! [Primate Sponge touches Squidward's arm and then sniffs his finger from what he touched. Tries to give some to Squidward] Uh, no thanks. [Squidward feels someone breathing on him and he turns and notices a Prehistoric Starfish breathing on him. Prehistoric Starfish smiles and reveals nasty, rotten teeth] Uh, hi there. Well, I better be going now. [Prehistoric Sponge grabs Squidward's tentacle] Yes, that's my arm. [Prehistoric Sponge puts Squidward's arm on his head and Prehistoric Starfish licks his hand] Oh, that's sweet. [Prehistoric Starfish gets scared; he smashes on the ground and gets the shivers] What, is it time for your flea bath now? [a jellyfish swims by and Prehistoric Starfish ducks for protection] Oh, look, it's just a little jellyfish. [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish run around screaming] Well, I'm going away now. [Squidward walks away] Ah, here's a nice, shady spot, away from those fools!
[Squidward plays his clarinet and each time he tries to play, Primate Sponge or Prehistoric Starfish holler, who are each giving a turn at holding the jellyfish]
Squidward: What are you simpletons doing?! You're supposed to catch these things, not torture yourself with them! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are confused] Give me those loincloths! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish tear off a piece of their loincloth] I can't believe it. [mumbles to self. Crafts the loincloth jellyfishing nets. Shows them the nets.] This oughta make things go a little smoother! [gives Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish their nets. They put the nets on their lips. Squidward facepalms and grabs the nets back] Give me those things! You're supposed to catch them, like this! [Squidward catches the jellyfish in one of the loincloth nets] It's called jellyfishing. [Primate SpongeBob and Prehistoric Starfish grab the nets and chase the jellyfish] Ah, finally. [sits on the ground and plays his clarinet. Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish hear it, go berserk and chase Squidward. Squidward runs into the time machine as Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish try to get in by climbing on top of it; Squidward screams] Get me outta here! [moves the lever up and down really fast and breaks it] Uh-oh. [the word FUTURE spins like a slot machine, and stops on 2 lemons and a "BAR"]
Time Machine: Loser! [Primate Sponge and Prehistoric Starfish are banging on the time machine trying to get to Squidward until it disappears into thin-air. The time machine shakes from the inside, with Squidward scared. The camera zooms in, with a "paint" effect, then camera is on Squidward's face, and a color change effect goes off. The screen flashes white, and the machine goes through all sorts of dimensions, with one with a computer-like area, then the screen does a color change effect again, with the time machine folding like paper, and it vanishes with a zap sound.]
[Squidward appears in a blank, white space. He walks around, and hears a strange voice. He then notices some colored tiles and lifts one up and it floats and vanishes]
Squidward: He's not here. No more SpongeBob. No more! I may finally have found a place where I can be all... [Squidward becomes tiny] ...alone! [a bunch of "alone" sayings appear with a different voice as each comes up]
Voices: Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! Alone! [Continuous "Alone" chanting is heard, as the screen continuously gets smaller and smaller]
Squidward: I gotta get outta of here! [Squidward tries to run, but he runs off and on the scene. He stops and tries to catch his breath. A strange voice is heard again, he holds his head, sweats a little, and runs again off and on the scene. He stops running after three tries to get out, yet another strange voice is heard when he stops] Where's the time machine?! Where's anything?! Where, where, where, where?! [jumps up and down angrily and busts a hole through the ground into the time machine. The handle is still broken off. Squidward bangs on the broken controls and sobs] I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I wanna go home! I miss Bikini Bottom! I miss my Easter Island head! I even miss SpongeBob! [right when Squidward says "SpongeBob," the time machine disappears and reappears in present time Bikini Bottom where SpongeBob and Patrick are still waiting for Squidward in front of his house] SpongeBob! Patrick!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hi, Squidward.
Squidward: Oh, I'm back! I can't believe this. I-I-I was in space, a-and I went to the future, and-and then I went to the past, and-and then-then I was nowhere, but now I'm back, and-and... you don't know how happy I am to see you guys.
SpongeBob: Does this mean you wanna go...
SpongeBob and Patrick: Jellyfishing?
Squidward: No! D'oh! Who's the barnacle head who invented that game anyway?
SpongeBob and Patrick: You are, Squidward! [They laugh as the scene cuts to the little island on the surface]
Squidward: I'm going back.
[SpongeBob is lurking around, heading home, looking for Sandy because they are playing karate. He suspects the pineapple of being Sandy]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! Oh, sorry, pineapple house. I thought you were someone else. [walks inside] Ah, what a great day at work. [hears something] Huh? Yeah... [tip toes over to the couch, but makes duck sounds as he tip toes. He realizes he's been stepping on squeaky ducks, and in frustration, he kicks them away. Then he runs in front of his couch] I know you're back there, Sandy! And I also know that nobody can hide from Sponge... [jumps behind the couch and no one is there] ...Bob. [has his back to the couch while he squeezes his eyes through the couch looking for Sandy. When he thinks he has spotted her, he runs out from behind the couch and in front of the TV] I got you now! Hi-yah! [no one is there, so he sits on the couch and watches TV] Well, I guess the coast is clear.
TV: [shows a realistic pink and yellow fish] Yeah, shopping's weird. Did you ever go into the seafood aisle and say “Who eats this stuff"? [TV audience and SpongeBob laugh]
SpongeBob: I love this show! [Sandy is sitting next to SpongeBob]
Sandy: Me too! [SpongeBob screams and begins to fight]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy puts on her green karate gear]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob high-kicks in slow-motion]
SpongeBob: Hi-yah! [Sandy runs off then drives forward, but SpongeBob jumps his upper half of his body to avoid Sandy] Uhh, just a second. [runs off, but returns with his red karate gear on] Safety first! [he winks] And now, spin technique! [spins around and lunges towards Sandy]
Sandy: Hi-yah! Yah. [SpongeBob grabs her hand and spins her around]
SpongeBob: Double overhand squirrel knot! [turns her into a round knot and throws her through the door like a bowling ball]
Sandy: I'm gonna get you tomorrow, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: That'll be the day. [spins his arms and legs around. Pans over to nighttime at Sandy's treedome, when the phone rings]
Sandy: Hello? [SpongeBob's arm tries to karate chop Sandy, but Sandy takes SpongeBob's hand and puts it through the phone to karate chop himself] Nice try, SpongeBrain! [hangs up phone. Later, at Barg’N’Mart, Sandy is shopping when a box of Kelpo falls. She thinks it's SpongeBob, so she gets in her karate stance] Yah! [notices the box of Kelpo] Heh, silly me. [But when she walks a few more steps, SpongeBob is there in his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, have you ever heard the one about the squirrel and the tin cans?
Sandy: I don't think so.
SpongeBob: Well, it goes like this! [stretches his arm to ricochet off a shelf and the ceiling to come at Sandy] Oh, wait, I forgot the punch line. [His arm stops right before hitting Sandy] Oh, yeah! [hits the loose board on the floor, sending Sandy into a pile of tin cans] That's a good one, isn't it? [later, SpongeBob is walking down the road] What a beautiful day. Beautiful sky. Beautiful plants. Hi plants. Beautiful... [sees a pile of tin cans on the ground] pile of cans? Mmm, mmm, Sandy, that is your worst disguise yet. [He puts on karate gear]
Sandy: No it's not, SpongeBob. [shows him a squirrel mask] This is! [jumps in front of SpongeBob] Now, prepare for a long, merciless whooping! [grabs SpongeBob's tongue and takes out a bottle of hot sauce] Mmmm, my favorite.
[SpongeBob whimpers in fear as a drop of hot sauce hangs over the edge of the bottle and Tom Kenny's face appears on the drop]
Volcano Sauce Drop: Eheheheheheh! [cut to SpongeBob's confused face, and then back to the Volcano Sauce Drop] By the powers of naughtiness, I command this particular drop of hot sauce to be really... really... hot!
[SpongeBob gasps.]
SpongeBob: Sandy! Wait! Victory is yours.
Sandy: I knew you'd come to your senses, SpongeBob.
[Sandy drinks the bottle of hot sauce. While she is doing this, SpongeBob takes out his tongue revealing a label that says "Novelty Toy" and he wraps the fake tongue she was holding around her and spins her]
SpongeBob: Yah.
[Sandy karate chops SpongeBob far away]
Sandy: Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: Curses! [Now at the Krusty Krab, the line is very long]
Customer: With extra cheese. To go!
Squidward: Three patties, four large oyster skins, on the double, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is still wearing his karate gear]
SpongeBob: Oh yeah. Gotcha! [SpongeBob opens a door]
Squidward: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: What? [karate chops Squidward's face]
Squidward: I'm going to pretend that didn't happen. [throws two pieces of paper at SpongeBob] Now fill these orders or leave, SpongeBob. We're very busy today! [SpongeBob runs out of the kitchen with tray of patties in his hands]
SpongeBob: Order up. [stops as he sees a customer karate chopping a fly. The customer turns into Sandy who is in her gear and winks at SpongeBob]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Now are you gonna... [SpongeBob throws the tray backwards at Squidward, causing the Krabby Patties to land on Squidward's head]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, Squidward. I was going through some records back in me office and--Huh? So, you got the hairpiece after all.
SpongeBob: Hi-yah!
Fred: [under the floor] My leg!
SpongeBob: Thought you could sneak up on me at work, did ya? Well, you can't! ‘Cause I'm fast, I'm mean, and I can do this! [does something with his hands] Ssss! [Points at Fred, then walks backwards] Took care of her, yes I did. [bumps into Mr. Krabs] Oh, ahoy, sir!
Mr. Krabs: What was that?
SpongeBob: But, sir, she snuck up on me. In my own dojo.
Mr. Krabs: Are you on some new allergy medication, boy?
SpongeBob: No, sir. Just practicing my karate, sir. Or kara-tay, as some call it.
Mr. Krabs: Kara-tay? You should be making me money-ay! With your spatu-lae! Now get back to work.
SpongeBob: Aye aye, capi-tay. Nice hairpiece, Squidward. [he walks off. Later, at closing time, Squidward is mopping the floor]
Squidward: SpongeBob, did you get those bathrooms mopped yet? [SpongeBob is staring at his hands]
SpongeBob: Yes, ma'am. I mean, sir. I mean, boss. I mean, poobah!
Squidward: [frustrated] Go!
[SpongeBob walks into the bathroom with a mop and a bucket in his hands. He hears a sneeze, so he opens a door, but nobody is there]
SpongeBob: Hah! [opens the next stall door and jumps in it] Sandy! [Mr. Krabs walks out of the stall with SpongeBob in his hand]
Mr. Krabs: No more.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs. [Mr. Krabs grabs a hold of SpongeBob's mouth]
Mr. Krabs: Shh! No more of this karate stuff, lad. Or you're fired. [lets go of his mouth and walks away]
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [walks out] No more karate? How am I gonna tell Sandy?
Sandy: Hi-yah! [jumps at SpongeBob and starts karate chopping him]
SpongeBob: Sandy, wait! I can't. Mr. Krabs said I have to give up karate.
Sandy: [stops] Uh-huh. Sure, SpongeBob. [Sandy karate chops him again]
SpongeBob: No, no. Really, Sandy. Stop.
Sandy: [stops] I'm not falling for it, SpongeBob! [karate chops him even more]
SpongeBob: No, really! Please, stop! [Mr. Krabs looks out the window]
Mr. Krabs: What the? [walks outside] SpongeBob! [SpongeBob screams]
SpongeBob: Ahh, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: What did I just get through telling ye, lad?
SpongeBob: But I, uhh, she...
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're fired!
Sandy: Huh?
SpongeBob: [high-pitched voice] Fired? [his face gets smaller until it's not there anymore]
Mr. Krabs: Eh?
Sandy: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob's face reappears and he then bursts out crying and runs everywhere] Wait, Mr. Krabs, it's not his fault! It's- it's mine! He tried to tell me, but I wouldn't listen! [SpongeBob is crying into a cup and drinking his tears. Now he's flipping over and over around Sandy and Mr. Krabs] Give him another chance, please?
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm. [grabs SpongeBob as he runs] Alright, me boy, I'll give you a second chance. But no more karate. It's poisoning your mind. [sniffs Sandy] Mmm, mammals. [walks off]
Sandy: Aww, shoot, SpongeBob. I guess you ain't fibbing. [she and SpongeBob sigh] Aww, that game was getting old anyway. It's not fun anymore. I mean, what's so fun about [karate chops SpongeBob] this?
SpongeBob: [laughs, then suddenly stops] Nothing. Nothing is fun about that at all!
Sandy: We can find something to do that's almost nine times as fun.
SpongeBob: We can? I mean, sure we can. Yeah! Like we can, uhh. [picks up a rock] We can squeeze things! [squeezes the rock and drops it] Woo! How much fun was that?
Sandy: Almost some.
SpongeBob: I know! We can act like plants. [lies on the ground and opens and closes his legs and arms] Photosynthesis. Photosynthesis.
Sandy: Wanna go to the park? [SpongeBob and Sandy are at the park. SpongeBob is holding a basket in one hand]
SpongeBob: Karate sure is dumb.
Sandy: Yeah, you can say that again.
SpongeBob: I feel dumb just thinking about it. [puts the basket down] Duuuuh! I'm stuuuupiiid! I like karaaateee! Doyeee!
Sandy: You like what?
SpongeBob: Not karate.
Sandy: Ha! I don't even know what that is.
SpongeBob: Me, too. I don't know what anything is! In fact...
Fisherman: [casting off his fishing rod] Hi-yah! Hi-yah!
SpongeBob: [giggles] For a second, that sounded like.
Sandy: Karate?
SpongeBob: Right now? I mean, no! What is this karate? [opens up the basket] Uhh, what do you want on your sandwich?
Sandy: Karate.
SpongeBob: What did you say?
Sandy: Uhh, mustard. Mustard! I want mustard on my sandwich. [takes out some mustard] There we go. [SpongeBob pulls out some barnacle loaf]
SpongeBob: How many slices of barnacle loaf do you want?
Sandy: One. Just one.
SpongeBob: One for you! [karate chops a slice off]
Sandy: Hmmm?
SpongeBob: And one for me! [chops off another slice in slow-motion]
Sandy: Ohh, uhh, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Hmm?
Sandy: Maybe just one more. Uhh, I'm kinda hungry.
[SpongeBob brings out the barnacle loaf again]
SpongeBob: Sure thing, Sandy. [lifts up his hand]
Sandy: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Sandy: Do you think, umm, do you think I could cut this one?
SpongeBob: Uhh, sure.
Sandy: Thanks. Hi-yah! [chops one slice] Is that enough?
SpongeBob: Maybe just one more. Or two!
Sandy: Or three!
SpongeBob: Or ten!
Sandy: Ten! Yes, ten! Because we're really hungry!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right!
SpongeBob: Right!
Sandy: Right! [chops off more slices and they fly everywhere]
SpongeBob: Time for buns! [throws a bunch of buns in the air and chops them in half]
Sandy: How about some tomatoes?
SpongeBob: And I'll cut the cheese! [both throw the cheese and tomatoes in the air while chopping them into a bunch of slices that land on the patties]
Sandy: And, what else should we slice? [SpongeBob grabs more buns]
SpongeBob: More buns!
Sandy: [Sandy grabs two heads of lettuce] And lettuce!
Both: Yeah! [both slice up more food to complete their Krabby Patties and one of the buns lands on an earthworm]
SpongeBob: Phew. Making sandwiches sure is fun. Right, Sandy? [Sandy has a dazed look on her face] Right? I guess I'll eat one now. [reaches for a patty, but Sandy karate chops his arm with her green foam hand]
Sandy: You're mince meat!
SpongeBob: [in his red karate gear] In your dreams! Hi-yah! [both start to karate chop each other. Later, Mr. Krabs is walking through the park, carrying an umbrella]
Mr. Krabs: Huh? What the barnacle? [Everything in the park is chopped in half. Sandy is chopping wood while SpongeBob rests on a rock]
SpongeBob: Do you think Mr. Krabs ever does karate?
Mr. Krabs: [clearing his throat to get SpongeBob's attention] Bleuhahugh!
SpongeBob: [screams] Mr. Krabs! [tries to hold a tree back in one piece] Uhh, hey, Mr. Krabs, how’s it going? [holds the rock in one piece] Nice day, huh? [half of the tree falls on SpongeBob's head] Oh, alright, Mr. Krabs. You caught me. But you know what? I just can't help myself. You're just gonna have to fire me.
Mr. Krabs: Fire ya? [grabs a couple Krabby Patties] I've got something else in mind. [at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Sandy are karate chopping up Krabby Patties for the customers. Sandy is chopping up the meat and SpongeBob is chopping up the mustard]
Sandy: I love karate!
SpongeBob: I love kara-tay!
Mr. Krabs: I love money-ay! [He holds some money]
Squidward: I hate all of you. 
SpongeBob: Ah, time for bed, Gary. [takes off shoes and socks but socks still standing up but when SpongeBob throws them on the floor, the socks go down and Gary puts them on his eyes]
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. [pulls socks off Gary's eyes] You know what they say: curiosity salted the snail! Mind your wandering eye, you little mollusk. Sweet dreams, Gary. [snores and a dream cloud appears with the background of Krusty Krab stuff. SpongeBob eyes appear then his shoes and then his mouth on a rock] Hey! Over here! [laughs while his arms wiggle on the ground. Both arms attach to the rock and the rock moves over to the other items. SpongeBob's arms grab the eyes and puts them on the rock, his pants start appearing, and then his legs come out and put his shoes on and his body is seen. A car comes over SpongeBob and sits him in it. SpongeBob's nose grows out] Wait a minute. I don't have a driver's license! [driver's license appears] Wow. My driver's license. I can't believe it! [Car starts to move crazily] I sure take a good picture. [drives through a sign that says "Road Ends"] Darn! I should have grown a mustache. [the boat starts bumping up and down rapidly; SpongeBob is now driving off-road, hitting bumps in the sand; he smashes into a rock and flies out of the boat, still holding his license] How could I have forgotten the most important rule of driving? Always wear your seatbelt. [flies over the Krusty Krab] Hey, I can see the Krusty Krab from here. [Mrs. Puff floats up to him] Mrs. Puff! Look! I've finally got my driver's license!
Mrs. Puff: [takes his license and tears it up] Not even in your dreams, Mr. SquarePants!
SpongeBob: No! [flies through the dream cloud and on SpongeBob's real bed] Ouch! Where am I? [walks and looks up to his real self] Is that me? Or is this me? Am I still dreaming?
Gary: Meow. [snoring] Meow.
SpongeBob: [walks up to Gary's dream cloud] This must be Gary's dream. I'm gonna get a closer look. [jumps into the dream cloud. He falls down into a library] Whoa! Wow. Look at all these books. I wonder where Gary is. [walks past a pile of books] Gary! Huh? [sees Gary, who is now taller and wearing a cape, reading a book. He walks up to him] Excuse me, sir. Have you seen...? [Gary turns around]
Gary: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Gary?
Gary: How dare you invade the sanctity of my dreams?
SpongeBob: Gary! You can talk!
Gary: [sighs] In dreams, one is not tethered by earthly limitations.
SpongeBob: What does that mean?
Gary: Come. [they walk down an aisle of books] For ages, dreams have been thought of as windows to another realm. [picks up a book and reads from it] "Let me not mar that perfect dream by an auroral stain, but so adjust my daily night that it may come again." Emily Dickinson wrote that.
SpongeBob: Who?
Gary: [flips a few pages] Here's one you might know. [clears throat] There once was a man from Peru who dreamed he was eating his shoe. He woke with a fright in the middle of the night to find that his dream had come true.
SpongeBob: [laughs] Gee, Gary, you sure are smart.
Gary: Did you think my shell was full of hot air?
SpongeBob: Well, thanks for the info, Gary. I'm going back to my own dream now. [starts walking away]
Gary: Beware of your wandering eye, you little poriferan!
SpongeBob: [jumps out of Gary's dream cloud and hops up onto his alarm clock to get into his own; sees Patrick's dream cloud outside the window] I wonder what Patrick's dreaming. [Patrick is stuck to the bottom of his rock, sucking his thumb and snoring. SpongeBob runs over] I can't resist! [laughs and jumps into the dream cloud. Inside, he opens a door to see Patrick rocking back and forth on a 25¢ kiddie ride amidst the blank, white scenery] Hey, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: [walks over] You know, Patrick, this is a dream. You can do anything you want.
Patrick: Yup.
SpongeBob: I mean anything! Watch. I can turn into a skyscraper. [transforms into the shape of a skyscraper] Going up! Eh? [sees that Patrick is unresponsive and frowns, then perks up again] I can make... [changes back to his normal shape and size, this time with a million copies of himself] A million of me! Eh? Eh?
Patrick: Yup. [the clones disappear]
SpongeBob: Ah, tartar sauce. I'm going to a different dream. [leaves]
Patrick: Okay. Bye, SpongeBob. [kiddie ride comes to a halt; Patrick reaches into his pocket and pulls out another quarter and goes to put it in the slot, but accidentally drops it and it rolls away] Oh! [the quarter falls into a grate] Shoot, that was my last quarter. [sits on the ride with a dull gaze; meanwhile, SpongeBob hops out of the dream cloud and starts to walk down the block; he stops below Squidward's dream cloud]
SpongeBob: Ooh, this is gonna be good! [inflates himself with air and floats up into the cloud; inside, Squidward is playing clarinet in front of an applauding crowd; he has a powdered wig on his head] Psst! Squidward! [waving in the audience; Squidward stops playing] Hey, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob!
King: Ahem! [sitting in the balcony above the stage] Why do you stop playing, Wolfgang Amadeus Tentacles?
Squidward: Yes, Your Highness. [Squidward resumes playing, but SpongeBob tells the king a joke. The king laughs and Squidward stops playing again. He angrily stands up] SpongeBob!
King: Hey! I have not instructed you to stop! Now play! [giggles, turns to SpongeBob and nudges him with his elbow] Oh, do tell me the one about the man from Peru again.
Squidward: [growling, pressing down on his clarinet] Sponge- [accidentally breaks the clarinet. The audience gasps] Bob...
King: [angry] I came here to hear beautiful music! If I don't get my wish, it will be your head!
Squidward: [laughs nervously]
SpongeBob: [as a clarinet] Squidward! [points to himself and winks] Huh? Huh?
Squidward: [throws his broken clarinet pieces off-stage. Speaking with his back turned] No way.
King: Ahem! [glares down at Squidward]
Squidward: [sighs and picks SpongeBob up] Please, SpongeBob, no tricks.
SpongeBob: Trust me, Squidward. [Squidward blows into him]
SpongeBob: [off-key] La la! La la la la la la la! [The audience gasps again]
Squidward: [stops playing] SpongeBob!
King: [crying] Wh-wh-why have you stopped playing that wonderful music?
[Squidward smiles and SpongeBob winks at him]
SpongeBob: [continues singing off-key]
Fish: [crying] His music touches me ever-so. I fear that my tears might stain my petticoat.
[crowd cheers]
Squidward: [bowing] Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! [the crowd knocks him aside into a fruit wagon and a fish grabs SpongeBob]
Fish: What is this instrument that produces such lovely sound?
SpongeBob: [turns back to normal and runs away while audience chases him. Squidward has climbed out of the wagon and is a mess] So long, Squidward! [Squidward starts to growl at him, but the audience members push him back into the fruit wagon and chase after SpongeBob. The King follows, too, laughing. SpongeBob runs out the door and flies away.]
Squidward: [starts tossing and turning in his bed, mumbling in angered pain]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob lands on the top of the tree dome] Hey! I'm at Sandy's! [Sandy sleeps in her tree and SpongeBob jumps in her dream cloud and opens a plane door] Aw, this looks neat! I wonder... [falls out of the plane and screams]
Sandy: [surfs up on a glide board to SpongeBob] Hey, SpongeBob, what brings you here?
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy! What's going on?
Sandy: [turns upside down] Well, we're free-falling from 114,000 feet, and we're gonna land on that itty-bitty target. [a target is shown on the ground and SpongeBob and Sandy spins around]
SpongeBob: This seems kind of dangerous!
Sandy: Not as long as you've got a big old parachute!
SpongeBob: Okay! [gives her a thumbs-up; both his shoes inflate]
Sandy: Not a pair of shoes, SpongeBob! Parachute! [turns upside-down again]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [lifts up a green parakeet perched on his finger]
Sandy: Not a parakeet! Para- [Lands in a truck of clam manure, parachute inflates out of time] medic...
SpongeBob: [screams as he crashes through the target, breaking the ground and flips on the real-life ground] Ouch! All right, that's it. No more messing with people's dreams. [sees a dream cloud coming out of Mr. Krabs' house] H-h-hey! Mr. Krabs. [climbs the anchor house and raises his head right under a pink flower in Pearl's dream. Shows a view of various girly decorations,other girly features and boyfriend portraits.] Uhh... Mr. Krabs?
Pearl: Hello, SpongeBob! [sits at a table with a green rabbit toy and a brown teddy bear, she pours some tea into the bear's cup]
SpongeBob: [waves] Oh, Pearl. This is your dream.
Pearl: You're just in time for the tea party!
SpongeBob: Actually, I was looking for your dad's dream.
Pearl: [Frowns] Oh. He's next door. [Rolls eyes, then shakes head in disappointment] Boys don't understand the sophistication of tea parties. Right, Mr. Stuffy?
SpongeBob: Bye! [gets out of Pearl's dream and goes over to Mr. Krabs on the right side of the screen] I bet Mr. Krabs' dream will be more robust. [peeks in the cloud and just floats on his backside in the large ocean until he hits Mr. Krabs’ boat]
Krabs: I've got you now, you slippery demon! [inside the boat, he grips into a fishing rod] You're putting up a good fight, yes you are. [SpongeBob hops into the boat]
SpongeBob: Whatcha doin’, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: I'm picking Neptune's pocket!
SpongeBob: What are you talking about?
Krabs: I'm talking about cold hard flippin' cash. [Moby Dollar appears from the water, caught on the fishing hook] It's the mighty Moby Dollar! [Starts reeling in, making the Moby Dollar come closer and closer.] Did you see her, boy? I got her! Here she comes! [Moby Dollar starts spitting out pennies] There she blows!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Look, Mr. Krabs. Pennies!
Krabs: Never mind the small change, lad. Get the net!
SpongeBob: [grabs a small jellyfishing net] This one?
Krabs: No, no, no, no! The money net! It's in me back pocket.
SpongeBob: [reaches into Mr. Krabs' back pocket and pulls out a huge wallet with Mr. Krabs' license in it] Wow! You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Krabs.
Krabs: Never mind that, boy. Ready the net!
SpongeBob: [opens up the wallet] Net ready, sir!
Krabs: [pulls the dollar out of the water and heaves it into the wallet] I did it! [gets excited] I finally did it!
SpongeBob: Congratulations, Mr. Krabs. [puts down the wallet and wants to shake hands with Mr. Krabs, but when he tries the wallet bounces toward the back of the boat; the wallet bounces away]
Krabs: No, SpongeBob! Don't let it go!
SpongeBob: Huh?
Krabs: Get it, SpongeBob! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it! [SpongeBob chases after it, but it hops off the back end of the boat]
SpongeBob: Hey! Hey! I...!
Krabs: No! [dollar hops out of wallet and jumps like a dolphin away in the ocean]
SpongeBob: This'll make a great fish story, eh, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: Oh, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Krabs: [ties SpongeBob up with a rope tied to a plunger sticking out of a gun] You're fired! [Fires the gun, shooting the plunger and tossing SpongeBob with it]
SpongeBob: [screams as he gets shot out of the dream cloud and into Plankton's dream on a building. The plunger is stuck onto a building.] Ooh! Hey, Plankton's dreaming about Bikini Bottom.
Plankton: Zap! [zaps a building near SpongeBob and fish come running out] I see you. [stomps up to another building, twenty times the size of his normal self] Zap! [shoots a green laser out of his eye]
Fred: My leg!
Plankton: I see you. Zap!
SpongeBob: Plankton! [tries to get himself untied from the rope around his ankle]
Plankton: I see you... [SpongeBob gets untied and drops to the ground] Zap! [zaps and disintegrates the building that SpongeBob was on, then walks to the Krusty Krab. People continue to scream in panic] Oh look, it's the Krusty Krab, home of the Krabby Patty. [stomps on it] Crush! [picks up the Krusty Krab sign and starts to lick it as if it were a lollipop and walks off] Lick, lick!
SpongeBob: This isn't a dream! This is a nightmare!
Gary: Meow! Meow!
SpongeBob: [Stops and looks. Appears more and more worried.] Gary! Gary! No!
Gary: Meow! [Plankton still coming towards Gary making giant step sounds]
Plankton: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
SpongeBob: Gary! [jumps over to Gary and hugs him] I've got you, Gary!
Plankton: Peek-a-boo, here comes my foot! [steps on SpongeBob and Gary] Yeah! Huh? [lifts his foot from pain] Yow!
SpongeBob: [looking like a thumbtack] I think he's got the point. [laughs]
Plankton: [Starts shrinking.] Waaaaaah! [as he screams his voice gets higher and higher until he goes back to his normal, puny size. Three burnt fish walk up to Plankton looking mad] Well, I guess I've got some explaining to do, huh? [Burned Fred lifts his foot about to step on Plankton] No! No! No! Not the face! [gets squished. Wakes up screaming and his dream cloud pops, making dream SpongeBob fall]
SpongeBob: [comes out and plops on the ground] Ooh! [SpongeBob walks home into his own dream cloud where his real self is still sleeping] Ah, that was fun and all, but it's good to be back in my own dream cloud. [goes to sleep] Ah... [wakes up after hearing his friends voices and faces hovering around his head]
Squidward: [Head of Squidward starts surrounding SpongeBob] SpongeBob! [The heads of Mr Krabs, Sandy, Gary, Plankton, Pearl and Patrick start surrounding SpongeBob]
Sandy: SpongeBob!
Krabs: SpongeBob!
Patrick: SpongeBob!
Plankton: SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [tossing and turning in his sleep] What do you want with me?! Leave me alone! No! No no no no no no! [Squidward taps him and he wakes up.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [screams, then sees his friends stand around his bed, except Patrick] Hey, what are you all doing in your pajamas? Are we having a slumber party?
Squidward: No. We are not having a slumber party!
Sandy: Do us all a favor, SpongeBob, and stay out of our dreams!
All except Patrick: [grumble in agreement]
Plankton: Take a hike!
Squidward: Don't we get enough of you during the day?
Gary: [In anger] Meow!
Patrick: [walks in] Does anyone have a quarter? [all stare at Patrick]
SpongeBob: [He is asleep in bed and dreaming that he is standing on a giant Krabby Patty, then black storm clouds roll in and it starts to rain Krabby Patties. One falls into his hands] Ah! It's raining Krabby Patties! Yeah! [runs around eating patties. Dream ends. SpongeBob wakes up to see himself chewing on his pillow. He spits it out and his stomach growls] A quick midnight snack and then it's back to bed. [kicks the pillow on the ground and jumps on it. Sees Gary meowing in his sleep] Aww, sleep tight, my little angel. [tip-toes past Gary. He tries to get down the stairs without waking up Gary but goes down really fast making a xylophone sound. He walks to the fridge] Ah, here it is. [grabs a jar of seanut butter out of the fridge and walks to the counter where there is food and utensils lying on it] Nothing like a sea-nut butter and jellyfish jelly sandwich to help you get to sleep. [as soon as SpongeBob takes a bite of the sandwich, he falls asleep. Behind him, the fridge is open and cold air comes out of it. In the morning, his whole house is frozen. The foghorn alarm clock breaks the ice. SpongeBob wakes up also shivering.] The fridge! [slides over and closes the fridge door, then sits down trying to get warm. He tries to stand up, but he slips and slides everywhere inside the house, and he breaks all the windows before stopping on his bed. He pulls the frozen covers over him, but the blanket breaks into pieces]
Gary: [wearing a hat and ear muffs] Meow.
SpongeBob: [slides into the bathroom] Oh, Gary, I don't feel like myself.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Don't be silly, Gary. I don't get colds. I get the suds.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: No, Gary. If I had the suds, I'd have bubbles coming outta me. [He sneezes. Pink bubbles come out of him]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I can't get the suds, [sniffles] because then I'll have to miss work! [puts his underwear over his mouth and nose then sneezes. Pink bubbles come out again]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: No, Gary. I like wearing my underwear like this. [turns around and has two bubbles representing his butt cheeks. Each one pops]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm not sick. I'm going to work. [at the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is cooking when he sneezes loudly and he pulls entire hat over his head to muffle it. Mr. Krabs comes into the kitchen]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's holding up those patties? [SpongeBob turns around looking pale]
SpongeBob: [weakly, visibly shaking] Right away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, what's wrong with you? You're paler than a baby sea horse. [Gary pops out of nowhere]
Gary: Meow. [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: The suds?
SpongeBob: [holds up the Krabby Patty on a plate] Here's that patty you wanted, Mr. Krabs, sir. [sneezes loudly, causing the patty to splatter all over Mr. Krabs' face]
Mr. Krabs: [wipes the patty off his face] Alright, SpongeBob, you're too sick to work.
SpongeBob: No, Mr. Krabs, I'm okay, honest. [Mr. Krabs opens the front door]
Mr. Krabs: No, now go home and get some rest. [SpongeBob walks off] Nothing personal, lad. I just can't have you sneezing all over my food! [customers overhear what Mr. Krabs just said and all spit out their food and panic]
Fred: My leg!
Mr. Krabs: No, wait! Wait! [All the customers scramble out of the Krusty Krab. Back at SpongeBob's house, SpongeBob is in his chair.]
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, I feel horrible. [sneezes. Gary hides in his shell with pink bubbles all over his shell. Gary has an angry expression when he shows his eyes] Oh, who am I kidding, Gary? I've got the suds, no doubt about it. [after he sneezes again, his right eye rolls down his face] I'd better take care of this before it gets out of hand. [picks up the phone and dials Sandy's number]
Sandy: [running on her exercise wheel] Hello?
SpongeBob: Sandy, I'm sick. [puts his eye back into place] Can you escort me to the doctor's?
Sandy: Oh, sure, SpongeBob. I'll be there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August in...
SpongeBob: Yeah, okay, Sandy, thanks. [sneezes pink bubbles through Sandy's phone. Later, as SpongeBob is getting dressed for the doctor, the doorbell rings] Coming. [opens the door]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob. Going skiing?
SpongeBob: I'm sick, Patrick. I'm going to the doctor.
Patrick: What? Oh, you can't go!
SpongeBob: Why not, Patrick?
Patrick: I know a guy who knows a guy who went to the doctor once, and the doctor's office is a horrible, horrible place!
SpongeBob: [sits in his chair] It can't be as horrible as the suds. [sneezes]
Patrick: Oh, it is, SpongeBob! Well, first, they make you sit in the waiting room.
SpongeBob: Is that the horrible part, Patrick? [Gary appears beside the chair]
Patrick: No, it gets worse. They make you read old magazines! [SpongeBob gasps. Patrick takes a piece of coral for a stethoscope] Then the doctor pulls out his stethoscope.
SpongeBob: No!
Patrick: Yes! It's a device so sinister, so icy cold when it touches your bare flesh, it... [takes the end of the piece of coral and puts it on SpongeBob's chest] Ssssss! [SpongeBob jumps and runs around]
SpongeBob: No, no! No stethoscope, no doctor, no old magazines, no hiss! No! [flips over on the floor] Patrick, I don't want to go to the doctor.
Patrick: Exactly. [SpongeBob sneezes. A pink bubble is in the place where Patrick's nose should be, then it pops]
SpongeBob: You gotta help me get better, Patrick. Please? Would you like to be my doctor, Patrick?
Patrick: What else are friends for? [later, SpongeBob is sitting on the table in his kitchen. Patrick is standing behind him. SpongeBob sneezes] It appears as though we'll have to plug up these holes. This oughta do the trick. [pushes a small cork in one of SpongeBob's holes. Then plugs up the rest of the holes with more corks] Voilà! [SpongeBob sneezes, but no bubble come out] Feel better?
SpongeBob: I don't know. [he sneezes more and more, which after every sneeze he enlarges himself]
Patrick: Help, I'm shrinking! [SpongeBob breaks the table] No! Please don't hurt me!
SpongeBob: No bubbles! Patrick, your treatment is working!
Patrick: You think so?
SpongeBob: Sure! At this rate, I'll be cured in no time. In fact, I'm going to call Sandy and tell her not to come. Thanks, Dr. Patrick!
Patrick: And they said I'd never make anything out of myself.
SpongeBob: [tries to press one button, but it pressed all because his fingers are too large] My fingers are too big for the buttons. [off-hook tone plays] Dr. Patrick, will you call Sandy for me? [gives Patrick the phone]
Patrick: Sure, patient SpongeBob. [Patrick calls Sandy, who is about to head out for SpongeBob's place] Hello, Sandy?
Sandy: Hiya, Patrick.
Patrick: I'm calling on behalf of my patient, SpongeBob.
Sandy: I'm on my way over to take him to the hospital.
Patrick: Uhh, uhh, that will no longer be required. He is in my care as of today.
Sandy: Well, I'm coming over to take a look. I'll be over there faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot...
Patrick: Oh, yeah, yeah, the rabbit. Don't bother, Sandy! [hangs up] Oh, SpongeBob, quick, Sandy's coming! Ah! We've got to make sure you're well, or she'll take you to the doctor! [runs into the kitchen with rubber gloves on and dips them into the sink of water] Don't touch me, I'm sterile! Scalpel, please. [takes some sea-nut butter and spreads it on SpongeBob's right foot. Then puts a piece of bread on each side and his shoe on it] Feeling better?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. [later, a string is attached to a door that Patrick closes. A tooth shoots out from the side]
Patrick: Feeling better yet?
SpongeBob: [missing a tooth] Not really.
Patrick: [jumping on SpongeBob in a ballet outfit] How...about...now?
SpongeBob: I don't...think so. [Patrick puts a big band-aid on SpongeBob's back]
Patrick: Feeling better?
SpongeBob: No. [Patrick rips the band-aid off while SpongeBob screams and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob's back]
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Nope. [Patrick rips the band-aid off as SpongeBob screams again and puts it somewhere else on SpongeBob's back]
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Uh-uh. [Patrick rips the band-aid off as SpongeBob screams. Later, Sandy arrives outside SpongeBob's house]
Sandy: Hello, SpongeBob?
Patrick: [wears a black mask on his head] Uh-oh, it's Sandy. [SpongeBob is tied onto a medieval machine. He sneezes and enlarges himself into a ball. Sandy knocks on the door] There's no one home.
Sandy: Patrick, you open this door. [Patrick is rolling SpongeBob away] Patrick, sometimes I just don't understand you. [SpongeBob sneezes] Hey! [walks over to Patrick's house] Okay, Patrick, where's SpongeBob?
Patrick: Uhh, uhh, he's not here at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. Beep.
Sandy: Okay, now tell me, [shows two rocks] since when do you have two houses?
Patrick: Since I ran out of space to put my stuff.
Sandy: Uh-huh. Yeah. Since when does your house have feet? [SpongeBob's feet are sticking out of the other rock]
Patrick: This is my mobile home. [SpongeBob sneezes the rock off]
SpongeBob: Hiya, Sandy.
Patrick: [holding SpongeBob's hand] Hmmm, the dirt therapy seems to be working just fine.
Sandy: Patrick, SpongeBob has to see a real doctor.
Patrick: No, he doesn't! I'm taking good care of him! Show her, SpongeBob! Say 'ahh'.
SpongeBob: Ahh... [a green substance-like gas spreads outs all over killing the plants, clams, and everything in its path]
Sandy: See? He's even worse than I thought.
Patrick: [wearing a clothespin on his nose] What do you mean? He's fine. [Sandy takes the clothespin off of his nose]
SpongeBob: I'm okay, Sandy, really. [sneezes again, enlarging himself more]
Sandy: I'm taking you to the doctor right now. [rolls SpongeBob away]
Patrick: Hey, that's my patient! [runs over and pushes SpongeBob the opposite way] You can't take him to the doctor's.
Sandy: [rolling SpongeBob the other way again] Don't be silly, Patrick!
Patrick: [carrying SpongeBob the other way] He's mine! [Sandy is log rolling SpongeBob the opposite way]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you'll be better soon. [Patrick is using a wheelbarrow for SpongeBob]
Patrick: I'll save you! [Sandy is using SpongeBob as a basketball]
SpongeBob: I'm better, guys! Really! [both push SpongeBob until he squeezes through them into the air]
Sandy: Now look what you've done, Patrick!
Patrick: What I've done? Everything was fine until you showed up.
Sandy: You should be arrested for impersonating a doctor!
Patrick: I am a good doctor, right, SpongeBob? [SpongeBob comes down and rolls away]
SpongeBob: Guys!
Sandy: Huh?
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I can't stop now! [screams while he rolls down a hill] Help me! [Mr. Krabs is cleaning some dimes]
Mr. Krabs: Shiny dimes.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob? [runs out the front doors] Stop! SpongeBob! Stop! [SpongeBob stops in front of restaurant. Mr. Krabs sighs in relief. Then SpongeBob screams as he sneezes so hard, the pink bubbles destroy the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is angry. Later at the hospital]
Purple Doctorfish: Well, Mr. SquarePants, it seems you have the suds. Are you ready for your treatment?
SpongeBob: [sniffles and shakes his head] You're not going to make me read old magazines, are you?
Purple Doctorfish: No, silly, you get the sponge treatment. Oh, Hans? [a real hand comes through the door and takes SpongeBob out of the room. Shows the hand cleaning SpongeBob with soap]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! [Hans is using real SpongeBob to rub a man (played by Tom Kenny)'s back in the shower] This tickles! [Hans uses real SpongeBob to scrub a man's feet. SpongeBob sniffs] I can smell again! [real SpongeBob being used to wash a plate, a car and the floor] Whoo! Yeah! Yeah-eah! Whoo! Yeah! [SpongeBob being rinsed off in the sink and put back in the doctor's room. SpongeBob is a normal, yellow color] I feel as good as new! I love the doctor!
Hans: Here is your lollipop. [hands SpongeBob a big lollipop. Sandy winks at SpongeBob]
Patrick: A lollipop? [takes a bubble wand and blows a bubble] Hey, doc, well I’ve got the suds, too.
Purple Doctorfish: [sarcastically] Oh, yes, Dr. Patrick, we have a special treatment for you.
Patrick: [Patrick gets taken away by Hans. He's being washed in the sink with soap] Hey! Hey, wait! [used on a cactus] Ouch! That hurts! [being used to scrub a toilet] Wait, this doesn't seem right!
SpongeBob: [opens his house door with a bunch of hearts in his arms] Happy Valentine's Day, Bikini Bottom! 

[throws hearts everywhere. He hands one to Squidward, but he rudely tears it up. He gives one to Mrs. Puff, but her boat runs into a fire hydrant. He gives Plankton a tiny heart using tweezers. SpongeBob leaps over to Sandy's place]

Sandy: Happy Valentine's Day, SpongeBob. I'm nuts for you. [gets out an acorn nut with an arrow stuck through it]
SpongeBob: [puts the acorn away and takes out a bottle of chocolate syrup] Well, I'm bubbles for you, Sandy. [blows a chocolate heart bubble]
Sandy: [Opens a door on her helmet for the chocolate heart to go into; eats it] Mmmm, chocolate. Mighty tasty. Patrick's gonna love the one you made for him. [a chocolate balloon is shown and then SpongeBob and Sandy run over and Sandy gets into the basket] Take me through the plan again.
SpongeBob: Okay. [SpongeBob blows a chocolate carnival] Step one: [manly voice] Patrick and I get to the Valentine's Day carnival. [a chocolate SpongeBob and Patrick fly in and hop onto the carnival] Step two: I position Patrick and myself on top of the Ferris wheel. [both of them hop over to the Ferris wheel where it rides up to the top. Blows a chocolate hot air balloon] Step three: You arrive at designated checkpoint for maximum visual contact. [the balloon floats over above the carnival] Step four: Patrick is thrilled. Mission accomplished. [chocolate bursts all over the screen and then we see Patrick with a Valentine's Day shirt and putting a big rock on the ground and pounds the rock into the shape of a heart and picks it up] Hi, Patrick.
Patrick: [imagines the heart is talking to him] Hello?
SpongeBob: Patrick, it's me, SpongeBob.
Patrick: SpongeBob, what are you doing in there?
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Patrick: Oh, my gosh! Sponge...SpongeBob is stuck inside this rock! [screams] Hold on, buddy, I'll get you out! [smashes the rock into a pile of dirt] SpongeBob? SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Patrick...
Patrick: SpongeBob! [cries and rubs the pile of dirt against the side of his face] SpongeBob...!
SpongeBob: Patrick, I'm right behind you! [Patrick turns around]
Patrick: There you are. [holds the pile of dirt in his hands] Happy Valentine's Day! Here's your present.
SpongeBob: And I have a present for you!
Patrick: You do?
SpongeBob: It's the greatest... [Patrick gets excited] ...the bestest... [Patrick gets more excited] ...the most fantabulous... [Patrick gets even more excited] ...present ever! [bounces and rolls all around all excited and overjoyed] But you can't have it yet. [Patrick stops rolling and bouncing around]
Patrick: Huh? Why not?
SpongeBob: Because it's not ready yet.
Patrick: Is it ready now?
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Patrick: How about now?
SpongeBob: Do you want to ruin the surprise?
Patrick: Yes!
SpongeBob: Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Patrick: Oh, come on, please!
SpongeBob: Hmmm...nope, sorry.
Patrick: [grabs on to SpongeBob's legs and feet] You gotta tell me!
SpongeBob: No can do! [laughs] You'll just have to wait! [SpongeBob walks off with Patrick still hanging on his legs and feet]
Patrick: Please. Oh please... [still hanging on his legs we see SpongeBob walking through the middle of nowhere] ...please-please-please-please. Tell me-tell me-tell me. Please?!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, here we are
Patrick: [gasps as he sees the carnival] You got me a carnival? Mine! All mine, mine, mine, mine. [Patrick runs inside the carnival and SpongeBob runs in behind him] Mine, mine, mine! All right, everybody out! This is my carnival!
SpongeBob: It's not the carnival.
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: [takes a quarter out of his pocket] Here, why don't you take this quarter and...
Patrick: [snatches it from SpongeBob] Oh my gosh, a quarter! I've always wanted a quarter!
SpongeBob: It's not the quarter.
Patrick: Oh.
SpongeBob: Now, take that quarter and buy some cotton candy... [Patrick interrupts and SpongeBob's finger deflates]
Patrick: Cotton candy! I can't believe it! [Patrick chases the cotton candy seller] Cotton candy!
Cotton Candy Seller: Hey, get away! Hey!
Sandy: Sandy to SpongeBob. [SpongeBob takes out a walkie-talkie where Sandy's voice is coming from] Sandy to SpongeBob. Come in, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Ten-four, Sandy, SpongeBob here. [we see Sandy closing in with the balloon on the carnival]
Sandy: [floating toward the carnival in the balloon] I got a visual on the carnival. You want me to bring her in?
SpongeBob: Ohh, not yet, Sandy. Patrick's still trying to guess what his Valentine is.
Sandy: [chuckles] You are such a kidder. Sandy out. That SpongeBob... [a group of orange flying oysters are heading toward the balloon] Scallops...chocolate-eating scallops!
Patrick: So if it's not cotton candy, then what is it? I can't take it!
SpongeBob: You'll have to guess!
Patrick: [points at a tent] This tent?
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: [holds up a man who is waiting in line for Heart-A-Whirl] This guy?
SpongeBob: No. [we see micro-organisms crawling around; it's Patrick's view through a microscope]
Patrick: This paramecium?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Nope.
Patrick: [giggles] Heh, you're a sly one. I can't find here in the carnival...because it's on top of Mount 'Climb Up and Fall Off'. [runs up the mountain and falls off then runs back to SpongeBob] It wasn't there either!
SpongeBob: Are you sure? [runs up mountain and falls off again; SpongeBob uses his walkie-talkie to tell Sandy something] SpongeBob to Sandy, you can bring it in now. [Sandy is using a whip to shoo the scallops away]
Sandy: Uhh, SpongeBob, we got ourselves a little problem. I got a pack of chocolate-eating scallops trying to rustle the balloon! Hi-yah! Get away, you sweet-toothed varmints! Hi-yah! I'm going to be a little late!
SpongeBob: Late? But what about... [Patrick still jumping on and off mountain] ...Patrick?
Sandy: Hing-ya! Take him up to the Ferris wheel and I'll meet you there! Sandy out!
SpongeBob: [puts away the walkie-talkie] If Patrick doesn't get his valentine... [screams]
Patrick: [suddenly appears from behind, all bruised] I'm pretty sure it's not up there, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Patrick! Uhh, actually it's on the Ferris...
Patrick: Ferris wheel! [he grabs SpongeBob and runs toward it; cut to them on the Ferris wheel being brought to the top] I'm ready for the greatest Valentine's present in the whole world now, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Well, this is where you're gonna get it...I hope. Just keep looking out there, pal. [SpongeBob talks to Sandy again on the walkie-talkie] SpongeBob to Sandy, SpongeBob to Sandy, come in, Sandy! [Sandy is still fighting the chocolate eating scallops]
Sandy: Sandy to SpongeBob, I got my ox in a ditch here! I'm way off course! The scallops are eating the balloon! They're everywhere! [One scallop bites the balloon and the air goes out and it floats down] Aw, shoot! We're going down, SpongeBob! Switch to plan B!
SpongeBob: No, no, B, Sandy! No, B! [Patrick is smiling big waiting for his surprise] Uh, Patrick, you know how sometimes you plan something special and things don't just work out?
Patrick: No...no...eh-gee! Holy mackerel! Is it hot up here or what?! [rips off his shirt and moves the ferries wheel seats back and forth and then up and down. Next, the ferries wheel is jumping up and down and then SpongeBob puts out his hand/arm]
SpongeBob: Patrick, here it is! [Patrick stares at SpongeBob's hand/arm]
Patrick: What's that?
SpongeBob: It's a handshake...a friendly handshake.
Patrick: A handshake? That's the big gift? You got me a handshake?
SpongeBob: A friendly handshake. Happy Valentine's Day! [Patrick shakes his hand and stares it and makes a grumpy looking face. SpongeBob laughs and throughout their playtime in the carnival, Patrick has the same grumpy look on his face. Later, the scene cuts to them sitting in the bench.]
Patrick: I've been thinking. At first, a handshake doesn't seem like much, but really it's the thought that counts… [a woman walks up with a box shaped like a heart full of chocolates in her arms]
Fran: Hey, SpongeBob, I just wanted to thank you for this box of chocolates.
SpongeBob: Uh, no problem, Fran. [walks off]
Patrick: And even though I was expecting more... [a man with roses walks up]
Dave: Thanks for the roses, SpongeBob. Happy Valentine's Day.
SpongeBob: You too, Dave. [walks off]
Patrick: And not that it matters that we've been friends for so long... [some woman walks by with a bike]
Female Fish: Hey, SpongeBob, thanks for the bike! [talking to Patrick] Can you believe this guy? I just met him this morning! [Patrick begins to fume]
Patrick: So, as I was saying...
Male Fish: Excuse me, do you guys have the time?
Patrick: [snaps and yells with rage, which is followed by him picking up and throwing the fish across the screen] [House of Horror music starts playing] Patrick needs love, too! [Patrick goes psycho freaky. A crashing sound is heard. He bangs his stomach like a gorilla, grunts angrily as he runs closer towards the screen, angrily approaches a balloon cart, then cuts the balloon strings from a salesman and smashes the balloon cart with his buttocks. Cut to scene where children play with a guy in a heart suit; the children run off as Patrick approaches] I defy you, Heartman! [Patrick rips the suit in half and continues his rampage]
P.A. System: Attention everyone, there's a chubby pink starfish on the loose! [everyone runs screaming; Patrick sees a twirl-around ride that has hearts on it and goes mad over it]
Patrick: Heart on stick must die! [goes to the pole and tries to pick it up; gives up eventually in tiredness; Patrick sees a little girl eating a heart-shaped lollipop] Heart on stick must die! [grabs it, breaks it, and stuffs it in his mouth. The girl screams as Patrick takes the lollipop.]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick!
Patrick: [Turns around with an evil look on his face; angrily grumbles gibberish, making everyone scared and run to a dead-end at the Goo Lagoon dock; Patrick roars with rage] Huaaagh!
[Everyone gets scared.]
Patrick: Give me SpongeBob! [SpongeBob is thrown in front of the group of citizens]
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously]
Patrick: You broke my heart! Now I'm gonna break something of yours!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, I know I deserve this. [notes the crowd] But, do they?
Patrick: They didn't get me anything either! [They throw a pile of gifts at Patrick's feet] Nope, it's too late for that now... for all of you! [walks onto and over the gifts, about to kill everyone, starting with SpongeBob. The citizens take a step back and SpongeBob is scared]
Sandy: Yee-haw! Get along, little shellfish! Gallop, you scallops! [whipping the scallops as she lands in the carnival with the balloon and letting scallops go]
SpongeBob: Yeah! Sandy's here! Woo-hoo! Look, Patrick, it's here! It's here! The best Valentine in the whole wide world is right behind you! [jumping up and down pointing behind Patrick]
Patrick: [ignores SpongeBob] Sure it is.
SpongeBob: I'm telling you, it's right there! Turn around!
Patrick: Uh-uh.
SpongeBob: Patrick, just turn around! [Patrick still wouldn't listen. Everyone is yelling at Patrick to turn around, but he doesn't]
Crowd: Turn around! / You nincompoop! / Why you?
Patrick: You must think I'm pretty dumb, huh?
Crowd: Yes! Turn around!
Patrick: No.
Crowd: Turn around! Turn around!
Patrick: Nuh-uh. I'm gonna say this once and I'm not going to say it again, so pay attention. I am not, I repeat, not going to turn around for any reason...ever!
Sandy: Howdy, Patrick!
Patrick: [turns around] Hi, Sandy! [notices the chocolate balloon, then is confused and speaks gibberish]
SpongeBob: Happy Valentine's Day, Patrick! [Patrick jumps for joy and jumps on the balloon]
Patrick: Yay! My valentine! Hey, is this solid chocolate?
SpongeBob: Patrick, no! [Patrick bites the balloon and chocolate explodes everywhere. SpongeBob and Patrick are in the mess]
Patrick: Aw, SpongeBob... you didn't have to get me anything. 
Squidward: [walks out and sits on his lawn chair] Ah, time to relax. [takes out some gum and puts it in his mouth. Throws the gum wrapper away in front of SpongeBob's house. SpongeBob's pineapple moves forward closer to the wrapper and he opens the door]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward!
Squidward: [spits out gum] Well, time to go. [folds up the lawn chair and walks to his front door, but SpongeBob stops him]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Now what?
SpongeBob: You dropped this little piece of paper.
Squidward: Yeah, so what?
SpongeBob: I just figured you probably want it back.
Squidward: What's the big deal? It's only garbage?
SpongeBob: Garbage?! But, Squidward, in the right hands, this paper is a gold mine of entertainment. A spectacular afternoon of underwater fun. A treasure trove of...
Squidward: ...garbage. [walks inside his house]
SpongeBob: So you don't want it?
Squidward: Right! [closes door]
SpongeBob: Does that mean I can have it?
Squidward: Yes, by all means, take it. [phone rings. Picks it up] Hello?
SpongeBob: You sure?
Squidward: Yes! For the final time, I don't want that paper. It's yours forever and ever! [hangs up and sighs. SpongeBob appears from under the table where the phone is. Squidward screams]
SpongeBob: So are you definitely, positively sure?
Squidward: Get out!
SpongeBob: But are you...
Squidward: GET OUT!!! [gets SpongeBob out]
SpongeBob: Last chance to change your mind, Squidward.
Squidward: Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg, and plead, and cry, don't give that paper back to me...ever!
SpongeBob: So, I take that as a possible no? Squidward? Squidward? Squidward? [Squidward closes the door] Okay, Squidward, that's a promise I'll just have to keep. Ah, Mr. Paper, I am so lucky to have a friend like Squidward.
Squidward: [walking up to his clarinet] SpongeBob... [SpongeBob is laughing outside. Squidward tries to play his clarinet, but Squidward gets annoyed by SpongeBob's laughter, so he peeks out the window] What in the world are you giggling about?
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Squidward, it's just... [giggles] ...it's just that I'm thinking of all the fun I'm going to have with this piece of paper! [Squidward walks back and picks up his clarinet]
Squidward: How can anyone have fun with just a piece of paper? [Squidward plays his clarinet, but has to stop due to SpongeBob's laughter continuing] Ohh...what can he possibly be doing with that paper?! [peeks out his window again and SpongeBob is running around with the piece of paper high, above his head]
SpongeBob: La, la, la, la, la. Gary, watch this! [twists his lower part of his body around and puts the piece of paper in it so it hangs out. Turns his lower body around] Guess what I am.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Well, yes, Gary, I am a sponge with paper stuck in his pants, but I'm also... [deep voice] Super Sponge, soaking up crime. See, here's my cape. [blows on the piece of paper to make it look like a cape in the wind]
Squidward: Super-moron's more like it.
SpongeBob: Now I'm... [jumps into the air out of his pants. He is now naked with a paper for a loincloth] SpongeBob JunglePants! [does Tarzan impression]
Squidward: Oh, boy.
[SpongeBob swings on a vine and lands on his pineapple house]
SpongeBob: Ugh. SpongeBob JunglePants summon animal friends. [he roars like a lion, makes bird calls, makes a raspberry, makes horn noises, dolphin noises and seal noises]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary. I'm not a jungle boy. I'm a box of army supplies, [jumps off his pineapple with his clothes back on] bringing relief to the hungry troops! [has the paper act as a parachute and floats down to the ground. We see Squidward watching from a safe distance] Landing just in time for the bullfight! [he waves the paper in front of Gary] Toro, toro, Gary! Toro, toro! Toro, Gary, toro... [pushes Gary across with his foot] Hey, ole! Now for some impressions. A guy with a mustache. [puts the piece of paper where a mustache would be] Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache. A pirate with an eye patch. [puts the paper over one eye] Arrgh, I'm a pirate. A regular guy with an eye patch. [puts the paper over one eye] Arrgh, I am not a pirate.
Squidward: Do a big yellow idiot with a stupid piece of paper. [SpongeBob is rolling the piece of paper on the top of his head. Then he sucks in the paper through one of his holes. Blows it in and out of his holes] How did he do that?
SpongeBob: Look, Gary, oral-gami. [puts the paper in his mouth and sticks his tongue out with a bird shape for the paper]
Kids: Bird! Yay! [SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a snowflake] Snowflake, yay! [SpongeBob does it again and comes out as a doll] Paper dolls, yay!
Squidward: Hey, that little paper does seem like fun. [puts his hand over his mouth] What am I saying?! I am such an idiot. [laughs] SpongeBob, honestly, and his dumb paper. He calls that fun? [opens up a magazine and starts reading it] Now, reading 'Boring Science Digest,' that's fun. [laughs at what the magazine says inside] Erosion. [laughs] Mitosis. [SpongeBob laughs. Later, Squidward is bathing] See, I can have fun taking a bath. [the paper comes flying through the window as an airplane and flies around Squidward a couple times as SpongeBob makes airplane noises. The paper then pauses mid-flight to "shoot" a rubber duck in the tub as SpongeBob imitates a machine gun before it flies back out the window. The rubber duck sinks under the water. Later, Squidward is painting] Painting fruit, there's nothing more fun than painting fruit. This is more fun than anything. [SpongeBob is laughing outside. Squidward paints, but he paints himself with the piece of paper over his nose. When he notices this, he tears up his painting] I'll prove to him that paper is not fun! [runs outside and whistles while playing paddleball] I'm having fun, la-la-la...
SpongeBob: [bouncing the piece of paper off his nose like it was a paddleball] Isn't this great? La-la-la-la-la... [SpongeBob jumps up and down] La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Squidward: Okay, SpongeBob, top this one. [takes out a ventriloquist doll that looks exactly like him] Hey, Lil' Squidward, what's gray and ugly and has six arms?
Lil' Squidward: I don't know, but have you looked in the mirror lately?
Squidward: What? What did you...? [SpongeBob laughs]
SpongeBob: Oh, that's a good one, Squidward, now let me try. [folds the paper in half] Have you heard any good jokes, Mr. Paper?
Paper: What happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?
SpongeBob: I don't know, what happened to the paper that fell in the ocean?
Paper: It was all washed up! [a bunch of people come up and laugh with SpongeBob then leave. Squidward runs off]
SpongeBob: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
Squidward: [riding a shell mobile] Haha, I'm having so much fun with my new shell-cart. Ah-haha. Hey, SpongeBob, can your stupid paper do this? [SpongeBob comes down with the paper acting as a helicopter]
SpongeBob: Nope. [flies away while Squidward drives his shell-cart through the side of his house. Then he comes out with his clarinet]
Squidward: Well, you can't play music with a piece of paper! [plays 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' off-key. Little black musical note symbols fall out of the clarinet as he plays]
SpongeBob: [applauding] Hooray! Hooray! That was great, Squidward. All those wrong notes you played made it sound more original.
Squidward: What? I didn't play any wrong notes. [plays the song off-key again. Little black musical note symbols also fall off as he plays]
SpongeBob: Yeah, see, you're playing it like this... [plays his piece of paper as the clarinet with the note symbols coming out] ...when ordinarily it goes like this... [plays the song on-key at B♭ Major] I'm partial to doing it in the key of A-minor myself. [Plays a jazzy song with higher notes. A music sheet appears as he plays. Music sheet disappears after finishing the song.] Ah, nothing like a duet between buddies, eh, Squidward?
Squidward: [grabs the paper but SpongeBob holds onto it] Give me my paper back! Now let go of it. I said let go of it! [SpongeBob still holding on to it] Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go... [jumps up and down]
SpongeBob: I can't!
Squidward: What do you mean you can't? [SpongeBob moves Squidward's hand off the piece of paper]
SpongeBob: I can't! You made me promise no matter how much you begged, and pleaded, and cried not to give the paper back to you ever.
Squidward: I never said anything like that!
SpongeBob: Sure you did, Squidward, look. [folds the paper a few times to make it look like a flip-book to what Squidward said earlier in the day]
Squidward: [In the flip-book] Take it, SpongeBob. Take it, please. And promise me, no matter how much I may beg and plead and cry, don't give that paper back to me… ever!
SpongeBob: Wanna see it again?
Squidward: No, I don't wanna see it again! Just give me that paper.
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward, I am sworn to a promise. [walks off] Maybe I should get going.
Squidward: Wait, wait, maybe we can trade for something. [looks around for something to trade] Yeah-yeah, something, something... [reaches in his pocket and takes out something] A-ha, wait up, SpongeBob! Wait! Hold on there, chum. [chuckles] I'm going to make you an offer. [SpongeBob looks to see what he has]
SpongeBob: Wow, pocket lint! [shows the pocket lint and rubberband in Squidward's hand] You drive a hard bargain, Squidward. Paper for lint, hmmm...
Squidward: Not the lint, the rubber band!
SpongeBob: The rubber band? Do I dare?
Squidward: Oh, dare, dare!
SpongeBob: [begins to reach for it] Okay... [stops] Oh, I get it. You're just testing me. Don't worry, Squidward, I won't let you down. A promise is a promise.
Squidward: Listen, you! [puts his nose against SpongeBob's nose] You are not going anywhere until we strike a deal. [Later, Squidward is bringing a TV over to SpongeBob's side in a wheelbarrow] Gotta get that paper. [walks back to get more]
SpongeBob: Squidward? [keeps walking back and forth with more stuff]
Squidward: Trade... [walks back]
SpongeBob: Hey, listen... [Squidward brings his house over]
Squidward: Everything must go! Well, that's the last of it. [all of Squidward's possessions are beside SpongeBob] I've given you everything but the shirt off my back. [SpongeBob looks at the paper]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, is this still part of the test? Because it's...(cries) it's really getting harder and harder to keep my promise.
Squidward: (sadly) Okay, the shirt! [takes his shirt off] Take it! Take my shirt!
SpongeBob: Squidward's shirt. I've always loved that shirt. Okay, okay, I'll trade! [puts the shirt on] I can break a promise for this. Squidward, do you want your other stuff, ‘cause this is all I'll need?
Squidward: You can have all that junk, 'cause now I've got this! I've got the paper, and you've got my useless garbage. [puts the paper on his butt and waves it at SpongeBob] I got it! Haha and you can't have it. [runs around SpongeBob] I got it, you're a sucker. You're a sucker, sucker! [laughs] At last, what should we try first, Mr. Paper? Impressions! A guy with a piece of paper on his nose. [puts the paper on his nose] Look at me! I'm a guy with a piece of paper...on his...nose. Hmmm. A-ha! Wait, wait, wait, wait... [puts the paper in his mouth and sticks his tongue out revealing a wadded up piece of paper that is wet] Tada!
Children: Boo!
Squidward: [Takes the piece of paper off his tongue and dries off it.] Okay, okay, uhh, helicopter! [puts the piece of paper on his fingers] Gentlemen, start your engines. I'm flying! Oh yeah, I'm flying! I'm flying! That's right, that's right, here we go now. [bends up and down trying to fly] I'm flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying, flying... [sighs] ...flying. [SpongeBob is looking at himself in the mirror with Squidward's shirt on him while Gary is playing his clarinet] Wait, more impressions. A guy throwing a piece of paper on the ground! [throws it on the ground] A guy stomping on the piece of paper [stomps on the paper then picks it up] I'm a guy who traded everything he owns for a...
Patrick: [walks up to Squidward chewing gum] ...a worthless piece of paper. [Patrick grabs the paper] Hey, thanks, it's just what I needed, Squidward. [blows a gum bubble then puts the gum on the piece of paper and throws it behind him in the garbage can] Nice shirt, SpongeBob. [laughs]
Squidward: [wind whistling] Does anybody have any sunscreen?
Mr. Krabs: [Looks around the Krusty Krab with a telescope] Where could they be? They should've been here hours ago! Arrgh! Not a customer in sight. If I don't make any money today, I'll surely break out in a rash!
SpongeBob: Yippee! I'm rich! Look, Patrick, eight gold doubloons!
Mr. Krabs: Wait, I saw it first! Hah! [Jumps onto table and sweats] Mine, mine! Huh?!
SpongeBob: Boy, Mr. Krabs, you sure are sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: What's this? Where are the doubloons?
SpongeBob: [laughs] There are no real doubloons, Mr. Krabs! It's a game: "The Flying Dutchman's Treasure Hunt".
Patrick: Based on a real treasure map.
SpongeBob: Take a break and play around with us.
Patrick: Yeah! C'mon, sweaty.
Mr. Krabs: Have you finished cleaning the tables?
SpongeBob: I cleaned the tables, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, but did you scrape all the gum off the underside?
SpongeBob: [chewing gum] I already took care of it.
Mr. Krabs: Ha ha ha. All right, lads. Looks like you've shanghaied me.
Patrick: My turn. [rolls dice] Five. [makes raspberry noise while moving piece. Reads card] One of your shipmates has been a bad pirate! Send him to the brig! Hmmm. [SpongeBob turns his eyes toward Mr. Krabs] It's off to jail for you, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Patrick, you're fired!
Patrick: But I don't even work here!
Mr. Krabs: Would you like a job, starting now? [puts hat on Patrick's head]
Patrick: Boy, would I?!
Mr. Krabs: [takes hat off Patrick's head] You're fired!
SpongeBob: My turn. [rolls dice] One, two, three, four. [picks up card and reads it] Look for the Deacon's Goose thru the fork in the old tree and head that way. [looks through the hole in the tree] Well, I see Mr. Krabs' zipper is undone.
Mr. Krabs: [gasps] Shiver me timbers!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Just kidding, Mr. Krabs. I'm almost to the treasure. Your turn again, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Ooh, fish eyes. One, two.
SpongeBob: [picks up card and reads it] You are a real pirate. Go straight to the "X" that marks the spot. You get to dig for treasure, Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Treasure. [digs and mini plastic treasure chest appears] There it is! It's the Flying Dutchman's Treasure! Gold, gold, gold. Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. [starts sweating profusely]
SpongeBob: Hey, Mr. Krabs is getting all sweaty again.
Fred: [walks into The Krusty Krab] Rev up those fryers, ‘cause I am sure hungry for one-- [Mr. Krabs picks him up, holds him over his head, and heads for the door] Help! Help! [Mr. Krabs throws him out the door] My leg!
Mr. Krabs: Can't you see we're closed?! [rushes back to the game table] Ready for another round? This is my kind of game!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: Six! One, two... [scenery changes from day to night. SpongeBob and Patrick are tired; Patrick is even asleep on the table] I win again! Oh, that's seventeen times in a row.
SpongeBob: I think we ought to call it a night, Mr. Krabs. I really got to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can't walk out on me now.
SpongeBob: I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs. [he yawns, slings Patrick over his shoulder, and carries him out] See you tomorrow. [walks inside house after taking Patrick home. Rattling noises heard] Huh? Who's there? [turns light on]
Mr. Krabs: Come on, SpongeBob. One more game. I can smell the treasure.
SpongeBob: [pushes Mr. Krabs outside] Mr. Krabs, it's late. Go to bed! Good night, Mr. Krabs. [closes door but Mr. Krabs is inside the house once again]
Mr. Krabs: Wind is perfect, the tide is right. Let's hunt for treasure.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, you gotta... [opens door, and Mr. Krabs is now outside]
Mr. Krabs: That's awful, lad. If the Dutchman hears you, we'll never get his treasure.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs...
Mr. Krabs: I'll roll for you, boy.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: [rolls dice] Eight paces, north, that's a good start, lad.
SpongeBob: But, Mr...
Mr. Krabs: One, two, three...
SpongeBob: [yelling in fury] MR. KRABS!!! I WANNA GO TO BED!!!!! Mr. Krabs, I'm sorry, but it's just a game, ya know?
Mr. Krabs: A game. That's... right. Of course it is, my mistake. I guess I got a little carried away, eh? On this treasure we're dealing here. Sorry, for disturbing ya, lad. [SpongeBob shuts the door. Morning arrives] Avast! Pineapple, ho. Heave two, and prepare to be boarded.
SpongeBob: Aw, go home already. I'm done playing that game, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: That’s Captain Krabs to you, and this is no game. We're gonna be pirates.
SpongeBob: Pirates?
Mr. Krabs: Ay! How'd you like to go on a real treasure hunt, with a real treasure map?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [Patrick appears from the side of SpongeBob's house] Treasure? [dancing around] We're gonna be pirates, we're gonna be pirates!
Mr. Krabs: Ay, ay, ay. Belay that skipping. Pirates don't skip. [throws them a bag of pirate stuff] Put on this pirate garb, so I won't be embarrassed to be seen with ya. Arrgh.
SpongeBob: Oh, Patrick. Look! Peg legs and eye patches.
Mr. Krabs: Now, don't you feel more like pirates?
SpongeBob: [Walks towards the plank using two peg legs] Look, I'm Peggy the Pirate! [falls on plank]
Patrick: [Walks towards the plank with two separate eyepatches covering his eyes] I'm Blind Beard the Pirate. [falls on SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ow.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh! [sailing underwater] Keep a sharp lookout, SpongeBob. According to the map, we're close to the first landmark.
SpongeBob: Really? Can we see the map?
Mr. Krabs: Uh... no! Only the captain can lay eyes on the map.
SpongeBob: Okie dokie, then.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, a pirate doesn't say, "okie dokie, then." A pirate says, "arrgh!"
SpongeBob: Okie... oops. [laughs while a jellyfish swims by him] I mean... [standing up] arrgh! Captain Krabs. [eyes widen] Captain, we're about to hit... uhh... I mean... arrgh, Capt., arrgh, we're, arrgh, about, arrgh, to hit, arrgh...
Mr. Krabs: Out with it man, arrgh!
Patrick: I, arrgh, think, arrgh, he's trying, arrgh, to say...! [crash] land...
Mr. Krabs: ARRGH! From now on, only the captain says, arrgh! Status report, Mr. SquarePants?
SpongeBob: The whole ship is underwater captain.
Mr. Krabs: Arrgh, we're marooned then. Our treasure hunt will have to continue on foot. This is it, boys, from the seaweed with two leaves on it. 10,000 paces east.
SpongeBob: But, Mr. Krabs, that seaweed has... [Mr. Krabs pulls a leaf off] Which way, captain?
Mr. Krabs: Ensign Patrick, which way is east?
Patrick: Uhh... let's see, uhh... [points] that way, captain!
Mr. Krabs: 9,997... 9,998... 9,999... 10,000! Where's the "X"? Supposed to be right here! 10,000 paces east.
Patrick: Ooh! East? I thought you said "weast"!
Mr. Krabs: Weast? What kind of compass you reading lad?
Patrick: This one, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That's west, Patrick. You're fired again. [cuts to the crew walking again] 9,551... 9,552...
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, we're tired.
Patrick: And hungry.
Mr. Krabs: Ooh. So this is my crew. You get a little tired, and a wee-bit hungry, and you want to shove off for home. Arrgh! That sickens me. A pirate is not judged by the notches in his compass, but by the sides of his booty. A pirate is judged by the loyalty and his crew. And without a loyal crew... [one of SpongeBob's eyes fill up with tears] what am I captain of? Just... a bunch of sand! [cries]
Patrick: Don't cry, Captain Krabs.
SpongeBob: [sniffles and crying] Yeah, we'll be your loyal crew. [both cry]
Mr. Krabs: You'll stay with me then?
SpongeBob and Patrick: We'll be the most loyal pirate crew ever!
Mr. Krabs: I knew I could count on you boys. One for all!
SpongeBob and Patrick: And all for one! [laying on ground at night outside tent]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't even mind sleeping on the cold, hard ground while Captain Krabs sleeps in his warm, dry tent.
Patrick: I'm so loyal, I haven't bathed in weeks.
SpongeBob: But we've only been gone a few hours.
Patrick: I know. [laughs. SpongeBob moves away]
SpongeBob: I'm so loyal, I don't wanna sleep till we find the treasure. Let's go see if the captain will go now!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Captain Krabs?
SpongeBob: He's not here.
Patrick: Look! The treasure map.
SpongeBob: Only the captain can look at the map, Patrick.
Patrick: Yeah...
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: Nothing.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're not supposed to look at the map. [Patrick touches the map]
Patrick: I'm not looking, I'm touching. There's no rule against that, is there?
SpongeBob: No, guess there isn't. [Both poking map. Map opens] Oops! Patrick, it opened by itself. [Both laugh. Eyes enlarge and search the map]
SpongeBob and Patrick: The map, the map, gotta see it, gotta look at it. [Eyes freeze for a second and then pop back in their heads.]
Patrick: SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yeah?
Patrick: Did you notice something familiar about this map?
SpongeBob: You mean, like that it's our game board taped to a piece of paper?
Mr. Krabs: [appearing right behind them] Do you think this is a problem?
SpongeBob and Patrick: [scream] Mr. Krabs!
Mr. Krabs: Sneaking peeks at me treasure map?
Patrick: We're sorry.
Mr. Krabs: That's mutiny on my ship. So you think ol' Captain Krabs has gone crazy, do ye?
SpongeBob: Not at all, Captain Krabs. We don't think that at all!
Patrick: I think that.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna throw you overboard for saying that!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Look! It's the "X".
Mr. Krabs: [eyes go into "X" like symbol] "X" marks the spot!
SpongeBob: Wow! That game really is based on a real treasure map.
Mr. Krabs: Well, what are you waiting for, lads? Dig! Dig! Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.
SpongeBob: We got it, Captain Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Ha, ha. Hand it up to me, lads. Heave! [Brings treasure up]
Mr. Krabs: We finally found it. [opens up the treasure chest]
Female Singers: The Dutchman's Treasure.
All: Wow!
SpongeBob: What are you going to do with your share, Patrick?
Patrick: I don't know. How are you going to spend your share, SpongeBob?
Mr. Krabs: What shares? You're not getting any of my treasure!
SpongeBob: We found it together. So we deserve a share!
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'm the captain. And I say it's mine!
SpongeBob: What about loyalty?
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob: And one for all.
Flying Dutchman: [sleeping] I'm the Flying Dutchman. [wakes up] Who dares wake the Flying Dutchman? Keep it down will ya? I'm trying to get some sleep.
Mr. Krabs: All for one.
SpongeBob and Patrick: And one for all. [Lightning]
Flying Dutchman: Who dug up the Dutchman's treasure?
Mr. Krabs: [shoves chest toward SpongeBob and Patrick] They did!
Flying Dutchman: Arrgh! So you two scallywags dug up me treasure?!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-huh!
Flying Dutchman: Well, you saved me a lot of diggin' you did. So here's an reward for the two of ya's.
SpongeBob: Wow!
Female Singers: Two Gold Doubloons.
Mr. Krabs: Wait! I'm captain of this crew! Where's my reward?
Flying Dutchman: Hmmm, I guess you're right. A little something for your trouble. [Flicks something to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Gold, gold, gold, gold, gold. Huh? Why, it's just a little plastic treasure chest.
Female Singers: Plastic!
Flying Dutchman: Aye, but it's based on a real treasure chest. [laughs]
Patrick: Gee, Mr. Krabs, you're looking all sweaty again.
[Flying Dutchman turns into green smoke and vanishes.]
[At Glove World! Where SpongeBob and Patrick are standing outside the amusement park]
SpongeBob: [Patrick is licking a glove-shaped lollipop] Another funtastic day at Glove World! [bus stops at the bus stop and both of them get in, but SpongeBob struggles for a bit with his balloon]
Bus Driver: Ahem. [points to coin deposit]
SpongeBob: Let me get my wallet. [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver's face] Wait, let me check this pocket. [turns around and the balloon hits him again] No... [turns around and the balloon hits the bus driver again] Patrick? Do you have any change?
Patrick: How much do you need?
SpongeBob: How much is it?
Bus Driver: Fifty cents.
SpongeBob: [turns around and the balloon smacks the bus driver in the back of his head] Fifty cents.
Patrick: Nope.
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] Lemme check my other poc-
Bus Driver: Forget it!
SpongeBob: [turns around and balloon smacks bus driver again] What did you say?
Bus Driver: Just take your seat!
SpongeBob: Thanks, mister.
Bus Driver: Yeah, whatev- [SpongeBob turns around and balloon smacks him in the back of the head. Bus driver gets very angry by this point.]
Patrick: Show me what you got at Glove World!
SpongeBob: Okay! Here's my glove light. [turns on light]
Patrick: Wow...
SpongeBob: [puts light inside his head] I see you! [both laugh]
Patrick: I got gloves for my glove action-figure! [puts a tiny glove on the big glove's thumb]
SpongeBob: Cool! [Patrick looks out the window and notices a sign that says "You Are Now Leaving Bikini Bottom" as they drive past it]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [a tiny glove is on his nose] Yeah, Patrick?
Patrick: Where's 'Leaving Bikini Bottom'?
SpongeBob: Where did you see that?
Patrick: We just passed the sign. 'You are now in leaving Bikini Bottom'.
SpongeBob: [gasps] What? [looks out the window]
Patrick: What's wrong, SpongeBob? [driving past a sign that says "Bikini Bottom City Limits"]
SpongeBob: Patrick, I think we're on the wrong... [Screams as bus drives down at a 90-degree angle road. SpongeBob and Patrick fly back and his the back of the bus] ...buuuuuuuuuuus!.... ...bus! [SpongeBob walks slowly up front. His face gets all distorted as he is moving closer. His pants rip off and fly at Patrick, but Patrick ducks in time. Then SpongeBob's briefs hits Patrick in the face. Bus comes to an immediate stop and both fly forward and hit the windshield. Then the balloon smacks the bus driver onto the windshield and all of them peel off. SpongeBob and Patrick are kicked off the bus] But, sir, we need to get back to Bikini Bottom.
Bus Driver: [hands balloon to SpongeBob] Oh, well. [drives bus away]
Patrick: What is this, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: [reads sign] Rock Bottom. [scroll over to a bus station] It sure is weird around here. Kinda different, even the soil looks different. [picks up some green soil]
Green Soil: Do you... [raspberry] mind... [raspberry] putting me down? [SpongeBob shakes him off as he gasps]
Patrick: Bob, I don't like it here. It's dark and scary. I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. Look, I can't even tell the bathrooms apart. [bathroom doors have the "?" on one door and the "¿" on the other]
SpongeBob: Uhh, that's an easy one, Patrick. We just wait for somebody to come out and then you'll know. [someone comes out the "¿" door. Patrick gasps] Maybe we should wait for one more. [a snake-like creature comes out of the "?" door. 3 creatures come out the "¿" door]
Patrick: I still can't read the signs. I wanna go home.
SpongeBob: Uhh, uhh, okay. You wait for the bus. Call me when it comes and I'm gonna get a bus schedule. [walks off] Boy, this place sure is creepy. [bus drives by with Patrick's head sticking out the window]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, the bus is here. [SpongeBob runs after the bus] SpongeBob...! [bus drives up the 90-degree angle road and SpongeBob tries to run up the road but falls down. Tries a couple more times but is unsuccessful]
SpongeBob: I guess Grandpa SquarePants was right. Don't run for a bus. [puts on Grandpa disguise] Especially one that's going up at a 90-degree angle. [takes off disguise] I better go wait for the next one. [later, SpongeBob is standing by the bus stop sign with his glove balloon in his right hand] C'mon, bus. I've got to get home and feed Gary. [notices shoe untied and lets go of the balloon] Uh-oh, shoe's untied. [Puts foot on bus sign] Over, under, and over, and loop-dee-loop, and over... [bus drives up and then drives off] and through the hole. [later, wind is blowing SpongeBob's glove hat on his side so he puts it back. Wind blows balloon away] My balloon! [chases after balloon jumping for it when he gets the chance. A bus drives up and then drives off] Wait! Hold on! Stop that bus! Aww, not again! [throws hat down. Notices a creature with a red light on his head for an antenna] Umm, excuse me, sir. Can you help me? [the creature gives raspberry] Uhh, uhh, yeah, I... [creature runs after balloon] No, no! Not the balloon! I need to know when the next bus comes... [bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob runs after it, but decides to walk back to the bus stop sign] Well, there goes another one. I gotta be more diligent. I am not leaving this spot, no matter what. [SpongeBob's stomach growls] I'm gettin' hungry. [snaps fingers] Glove candy dispenser. Good thing I went to Glove World!. [squeezes out 6 tiny glove candies onto his tongue, then spits them out] Eww, glove flavored! Hey, what's that? [a kandy machine is shown across the road] A candy machine. Mmm, kelp nougat crunch. Mmm... [Checks each side of the road to see if a bus is coming] I'm not leaving this spot, no matter what! [stomach growls] I'll only be gone a second. [runs over to the machine. While getting out a quarter, a bus drives up. Runs back across to bus] Hey! [bus drives off] Ooh! [stomach growls. Takes a few steps across the road and turns around to check for the bus. Takes a few more steps and checks again. Gets to the candy machine and takes out the quarter. Before inserting it, he checks for a bus. There's no bus so he puts in the quarter but a bus DOES come and drives off. Now he checks to his left down the road and decides to sprint across and get some candy. Pushes some buttons and checks for the bus. The candy is slowly coming down] Come on, come on! [candy drops to the bottom. SpongeBob grabs for it, but a bus drives up and then drives off. SpongeBob gets angry. He reaches for the candy but a bus comes up. Every time he reaches for the candy, the bus drives forward but when he pulls his arm away, the bus drives backwards. So he decides to leave the candy and run after the bus, but the bus drives off before he can get there. A creature comes up and takes the candy] Hey, that was mine! [walks over to the candy machine. 3 buses drives up and drive off while he's over there so he decides to run back. No more buses come, so he shakes the bus sign angrily] Barnacles! Alright, that's it. No more mister nice guy. [later, SpongeBob is at the candy machine staring at it and a bus drives up. Another SpongeBob tip-toes up, but the SpongeBob at the candy machine falls over revealing it to be made of wood. The bus drives off] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob is now a bench. A bus drives up, but drives off after it notices the SpongeBob bench] Fish paste! [walking into the bus station] I'm getting to the bottom of this, right now! I want a bus to Bikini Bottom. I am first in line and no one is going to tell me, otherwise! [sees a giant green round creature standing behind him already in line] Okay, second. I am second in line. [sees another giant creature already in line] Okay, third is good. [another creature is already in line] Fourth, not bad. [Cut to SpongeBob at the end of the line behind a yellow creature] Okay, 329. I am 329th in line and nobody forget it. [yellow creature spits out a giant egg on SpongeBob's head with the number 329 on it]
Window Attendant: Next. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Well, at least the line is moving. [everyone steps forward. Egg hatches 3 baby yellow creatures that jump in front of SpongeBob, thus making him now 331st in line. SpongeBob gets extremely angry. He lets out an angry grunt.] Tartar sauce! [SpongeBob hides inside his clothes and goes ballistic. Then comes out and everyone staring at him turns around]
Window Attendant: [time is going fast. raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. [raspberry] Next. Next...
SpongeBob: Finally! Yes, I'm next! [runs up to the window] When is the next bus to Bikini Bottom?
Window Attendant: What? [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The bus schedule. The next bus.
Window Attendant: I can't... [raspberry] understand... [raspberry] your accent. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: The next bus... [raspberry] to Bikini... [raspberry] Bottom. [long raspberry]
Window Attendant: Ohh. [raspberry] Why didn't you say so? [raspberry] Next bus leaves in... [raspberry] 5 seconds. [bus leaves] Ohh, tough luck, kid. [raspberry] That's the last one til' morning. [raspberry]
SpongeBob: Oh, [raspberry] no... [raspberry] you don't! [raspberry]
Window Attendant: Goodnight! [puts closed sign up]
SpongeBob: Hold it, I'm not through here! [raspberry] Do you hear me? [raspberry] I demand you come back and give me a bus to Bikini Bottom, right now. And until then, I am not leaving this spot! [gives 3 raspberries. Lights turn off. SpongeBob laughs nervously] Okay, like I said, I'll be right here when you get back. At this spot. In the dark. By myself. With no one around. Except my glove light! [turns on light] Ah, that's better.
[The glove light stops working; short pause.]
SpongeBob: This isn't your average everyday darkness. This is... advanced darkness. Hey... [closes eyes] if I close my eyes, it doesn't seem so dark.
[A raspberry is heard in the distance; he opens his eyes]
SpongeBob: Who's there? [walks down the road] Well, I guess that spot will be there tomorrow. I better just keep walking. [hears another raspberry] Running! Better start running! Running! [hears another raspberry] Sprinting! I just gotta keep sprinting! [runs into the 90-degree angle road. Sits down with scallops flying around his head] Sitting, sitting. Bleeding. [hears noise] Hey, who's there? [hears another raspberry] Okay, that's enough. [hears another raspberry] Don't come closer. [hears another raspberry] I'm warning you! [hears another raspberry] I'm a sponge! [a red light shines around SpongeBob. It's the friendly creature from before that chased after the balloon] Oh, it's only you. [the creature ties balloon to SpongeBob's wrist] Well, that solves my balloon problem, but I have a bigger problem. [the creature begins blowing balloon bigger] I'm kinda stuck here. I need to catch a bus to get home. You don't understand a word I'm saying, do you? Balloon... [raspberry] has... [raspberry] enough... [raspberry] air... [raspberry] thanks. [gives a few more raspberries as he is floating up] Hey, I get it, balloon travel. Thank... [raspberry] you! [raspberry]
Creature: You're welcome!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob, with the balloon still tied to his wrist, floats all the way back home] Ah, home at last. [balloon pops]
Patrick: [riding another bus to Rock Bottom] Don't worry, SpongeBob, I'm coming back for ya! 
SpongeBob: Good morning, Bikini Bottom! Ahhh, what a beautiful day! [SpongeBob's hand appears from a sand castle pineapple with his face drawn on his hand] I wonder if Patrick's at home.
Patrick: Hiya, SpongeBob! [Patrick's hand comes over from a sand castle rock with his face drawn on his hand] Whatcha doin'?
SpongeBob: Goin' over to Sandy's place. [both hands walk off together and arrive at a sand-made treedome] Hey, what's this? This doesn't look like Sandy's place.
Sandy: Don't lose your barnacles, boys. Hi-yah! [Chops sand castle peak down making a sand image of Texas] There it is!
SpongeBob: What is it?
Sandy: Can't you see? It's Texas.
SpongeBob: Texas? What's a Texas? [a wave covers sand and ruins Sandy's Texas display]
Sandy: Ohh, it's nothing but a memory now.
SpongeBob: All right then. Let's make one of your treedome.
Sandy: You know, all of a sudden, I don't feel like sand castles, SpongeBob. I'll see y'all later. [walks off]
SpongeBob: Sandy? Hi-yah!
Sandy: Aww, SpongeBob, I'm not feeling up to karate now.
SpongeBob: Oh-ho. I get it. Not feeling up to karate, huh? Whatever you say, Sandy. [Turns around] Boy, I hope Sandy doesn't attack me from me from behind. Hi-yah! [grabs Don the Whale from behind and flips him over onto the ground. Don growls like a dog and punches SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Uhh, Sandy? [surfs in the air] Surf's up, Sandy!
Sandy: No, thanks. [enters Jellyfish Fields. Jellyfish are heard buzzing]
SpongeBob: [Runs after a jellyfish with a net] Boy, there's nothing like going jellyfishing! [Patrick runs after one while laughing, then falls on his face. He gets up and runs again]
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy, we caught one!
Sandy: Listen, SpongeBob. Right now, I don't want to build sand castles, play karate, or eat jellyfish.
SpongeBob: [laughs] We don't eat 'em! We let 'em go!
Patrick: Fly away, little critter!
SpongeBob: Go on, go back to where you belong. [the jellyfish flies away as Sandy watches teary-eyed] Run along, back to your family and friends. I know they miss you as much as you miss them. Hurry, before they forget you and leave you behind. Remember: there's no place like home! [Sandy cries filling her helmet with tears. She takes a flusher handle and attaches it to her helmet, then she pulls it down and all the water drains out. Sandy gasps for air and pants] Sandy, what the heck are you crying about?
Sandy: I ain't crying! My helmet just sprung a leak!
SpongeBob: [suspicious] Sandy...
Sandy: [confessing] Oh, I guess I'm just feeling a little homesick.
SpongeBob: Homesick, huh? [SpongeBob thinks, and later, Sandy is blindfolded as SpongeBob and Patrick take her somewhere] Almost there.
Sandy: Heck gum it, SpongeBob, what is it?
SpongeBob: Da-ta-dah. [the three are standing outside the Treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Welcome home, Sandy!
[pause. Sandy cries and runs into the treedome]
SpongeBob: Sandy?
Sandy: Go away. [pulls a lever which brings down a metal covering on the treedome]
SpongeBob: I don't get it, Patrick! What's wrong with Sandy?
Patrick: Maybe it's just a squirrel thing. [a hole opens up in the top of the dome and Sandy comes out wearing a cowgirl hat and holding a guitar. Sandy tunes it]
Sandy: ♪Wish I was back in Texas. The ocean's no place for a squirrel.♪ [live action Texas scenery appears behind her] ♪Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world oh no. I guess that deep in my heart, I'll always be a Texas girl. I wanna go hooooooooooooooome, home.♪ [some clams howl along. SpongeBob and Patrick hear the music]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick, do you hear that? [Patrick has the notes going around him]
Patrick: Arrrgh! Get them off me! Get them off me!
SpongeBob: Wait, Patrick, listen. It's Sandy.
Sandy: ♪I wanna wake up in Texas.♪ [live action scenery is shown] ♪I miss those wide open skies. I miss my twenty acres, barbecues and pecan pies, oh, why? When I'm so far from you Texas, all I can do is cry.♪ [a live-action squirrel sheds a tear. SpongeBob and Patrick start sobbing. At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs hears the song, too, and starts sobbing also and accidentally gets hit by the cash register.]
Fish #1, #2, #3: Please Make It Stop! [Two customers are also sobbing; one dries his eyes with his Krabby Patty and gives it to the next person who blows his nose on it]
Sandy: ♪I wanna go hoooommme.♪ [Junior Brown's voice] ♪I wanna go home.♪ [as she sings she goes back into the Treedome. SpongeBob and Patrick continue sobbing and then stop]
Patrick: Do you think she knows the Muffin Man song?
SpongeBob: Patrick, she sang that song from her heart. She really misses Texas.
Patrick: Well, let's get some Texas and bring it down here!
SpongeBob: Patrick, we can't...that's it! Patrick, your genius is showing!
Patrick: [mishears, and frantically covers himself] Where?
[Later, SpongeBob and Patrick have gotten everything ready at the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: Everything looks perfect. We're going to get Sandy now.
Mr. Krabs: [from inside] Well, hurry up, lads! We can't squat like this forever!
[at Sandy's house where SpongeBob & Patrick are playing leapfrog while going to her treedome]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Krusty Krab! Krusty Krab! Sandy's surprise is at the Krusty Krab!
Patrick: Wait until she sees the...
SpongeBob: Shh! Don't spoil the surprise! [SpongeBob knocks, Sandy opens her door]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hey, Sandy!
SpongeBob: You want to come with us to the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [walks out with two suitcases] Hey, SpongeBob. Hey, Patrick.
SpongeBob: What are you doing with those bags?
Sandy: I'm going back home to Texas.
SpongeBob: What?! Now?! You can't! I mean we...
Sandy: It's time for this tumbleweed to tumble on home.
SpongeBob: Wait, Sandy! You can't! Uhh, we we're gonna...the...the...Krusty Krab...that is not the right direction! Wait, if you don't...if I can't...augh! Sandy! Wait a second! You don't wanna leave without having one last Krabby Patty down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: I'm tired of fish food, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: But, Sandy, don't you want to say goodbye to all your friends down at the Krusty Krab?
Sandy: [gets on a bus] I just can't do that, SpongeBob. It'd be too sad.
SpongeBob: No, no! Wait! Sandy! [the bus drives off] I can't believe she's gone.
Patrick: Yeah. What's so great about dumb ol' Texas? [the bus suddenly speeds back; the doors open revealing a very angry Sandy]
Sandy: What did you say?
Patrick: Texas is dumb?
Sandy: [the bus drives off again] Don't you dare take the name of Texas in vain!
SpongeBob: You mean we can't say anything bad about dumb ol' Texas?
Sandy: No, you can't!
Patrick: Then can we say people from Texas are dumb?
Sandy: No! You can't say nothing about Texas!
SpongeBob: [gets an idea] Oh, so you mean we can't say anything bad about... [turns around; grabs his behind and shakes it and rolls eyes] Texas!
Sandy: [blushes angrily] I'm warnin' you, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Look, Patrick, I'm Texas! Duh, howdy, y'all! Howdy y'all!
Patrick: I'm Texas, too! Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
SpongeBob: Howdy y'all!
Patrick: Git a dog, little longie! Git a dog!
Sandy: Y'all best cut it out!
SpongeBob: [while Patrick does armpit farts] The stars at night are dull and dim, whenever they have to be over dumb ol' stupid Texas! [Sandy gets steaming mad. SpongeBob turns into the shape of Texas] Hey, Patrick, what am I now?
Patrick: Uhh, stupid?
SpongeBob: No, I'm Texas!
Patrick: What's the difference?! [SpongeBob and Patrick laugh]
Sandy: [drops suitcases] Y'all best apologize, or I'm gonna be on you like ugly on an ape!
SpongeBob: You'll have to catch us first! [SpongeBob and Patrick run off] We did it! We got her!
Patrick: Krusty Krab, here we come! [turns head around to Sandy] Can we say that plants from Texas are dumb? Can we say that shoes from Texas are dumb?
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, that's enough.
Patrick: Why? You think that old slowpoke Texas is gonna... [...catch up, which she is. And fast. Patrick's eyes bug out and he screams]
SpongeBob: Run faster, Patrick! [both of them scream; they go around each side of a huge rock. Sandy crashes right through the rock, obliterating it, and walks with a twirling rope. Her shoe engulfs the screen, Sandy ropes Patrick and brings him into the background]
Patrick: [screams] SpongeBob! [Nuclear explosion is heard and a mushroom cloud appears. SpongeBob screams. SpongeBob stops in front of a leaf and shakes as Sandy karate chops the leaf and SpongeBob in half]
Sandy: Hi-yah! [SpongeBob jumps with his halves and he gets back together] Y'all gonna take back what ya said!
SpongeBob: No! Almost there! [runs toward the Krusty Krab. Sandy's rope turns into the shape of SpongeBob; SpongeBob screams. As he jumps for the Krusty Krab, Sandy throws her rope. SpongeBob hangs onto the door as Sandy pulls him towards her]
Sandy: SpongeBob, you've been messing with the bull! Now here come the horns!
SpongeBob: Sandy, no! [the front of the Krusty Krab tears off as Sandy has pulled tight enough]
Everyone: Howdy, y'all!
Sandy: Wha-what's this?
SpongeBob: It's a party!
Patrick: [hops over with arms and legs tied and covered in bandages] For you!
Sandy: For me?!
SpongeBob: It's your own little slice of Texas! Check it out, Sandy! We got square dancing... [Flats is holding a square] ...giant Barbecues... [Squidward is holding a sharp, spiky Q]
Squidward: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
SpongeBob: ...homemade peas-in-a-can pie... [Pearl is holding a pie with a can of peas in it] ...and we got our very own 10 gallon hats! [SpongeBob and Patrick put ten gallon water jugs on their heads] So, what do ya think? Are you gonna stay?
[Sandy starts to laugh and tears of laughter spew out and fill her helmet. Everyone frowns as tears start to well up in SpongeBob and Patrick's eyes']
SpongeBob: Don't cry anymore, Sandy, I'll go get your bags.
Sandy: [takes out the flusher handle, attaches it to her helmet and flushes the water out again] I'm not crying, I'm laughing! I appreciate what y'all are trying to do, SpongeBob, but home isn't about barbecues and pecan pies, home is where you're surrounded by critters that care about ya. [Everyone gathers around Sandy]
Sandy: Huh? Duh. What am I doing? I was home all along, and it took me until now to realize it.
SpongeBob: Does that mean you'll stay?
Sandy: I'm staying! [Everyone cheers, except Squidward]
SpongeBob: That makes me feel all wiggly.
Patrick: Yeah, who needs dumb ol' Texas? [cheering stops; cut back to the Bikini Atoll]
Sandy: What did you just say?!
Patrick: Should I start running now? 
[metallic roaring]
Plankton: [enters Goo Lagoon and he uses his bulldozer to remove the sign. He leaves his bulldozer] Attention, beach-goers! You are trespassing! You have exactly seventeen minutes to haul your carcasses off the future site of the [puts up a sign] 'Chum Bucket Mega Bucket.' [he makes a loud squeaking noise that catches some of the beachgoers' attention]
Tina: Do you hear something? [Peterson doesn't hear anything, and he shakes his head "no." The Lifeguard thinks the sound is coming from his megaphone, looks inside it and then turns it upside-down and shakes it.]
Plankton: [takes out megaphone] Okay, have it your way. I don't mind bulldozing over each and every one--
Billy: [grabs Plankton's bulldozer] Mommy, look! Somebody left this toy tractor here.
Evelyn: Put that down, Billy, that has germs on it.
Billy: [drops the bulldozer] Aw, mom.
Plankton: [talks through megaphone] You'll see. [throws away the megaphone] You'll all see! The future site of the Chum Bucket Mega Bucket must be clear to these cretinous beachgoers. But it's becoming increasingly obvious. I can deny it no longer! [zoom out] I am small. I need someone big to clear the beach for me. I need... [giant foot almost steps on Plankton but he dives out of the way] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo! Steppin' on the beach! Doo-doo-doo-doo!
Plankton: Yes. He's the one. [laughs evilly. The sand on his head falls off]
SpongeBob: I'll have one... [some kid cuts in front of him]
Monroe: Two, please. [Lou gives him two ice creams] Thanks. [walks off]
SpongeBob: One, please. [Electric Eel slithers through SpongeBob and grabs the ice cream]
Eel: Excuse me. [walks off licking the ice cream]
SpongeBob: One, please.
Lou: Sorry, kid. We're all out.
SpongeBob: Aww, barnacles. [he hears crying coming from Plankton, who's sitting on a bench with two ice creams] Plankton, what are you doing here? And why are you crying?
Plankton: Oh, hi, SpongeBob. [blows his nose] I'm cryin' because I've got these two ice cream cones, but I only need one! [cries] I don't know what to do with the other one! [SpongeBob is confused; Plankton cries then stops for a second and looks at SpongeBob and cries again.]
SpongeBob: I'll eat one of those ice cream cones for ya.
Plankton: SpongeBob! Would you do that for me?
SpongeBob: Sure! [starts to lick the ice cream]
Plankton: SpongeBob? [SpongeBob is still licking the ice cream] SpongeBob? [SpongeBob eats the whole ice cream and is now licking what's left inside. Plankton uses his megaphone to get SpongeBob's attention] SPONGEBOB!
SpongeBob: [turns towards Plankton] Yeah? [spits out ice cream as he talks]
Plankton: Isn't it great to get the things you desire? Like that ice cream cone, for instance. [SpongeBob licks his fingers] You can have anything you want with a little training. [SpongeBob licks his fingers again]
SpongeBob: Training?
Plankton: Yes. You just have to learn to be more assertive. And I can show you how.
SpongeBob: Assertive, huh?
Plankton: That's right.
SpongeBob: Anything I want. [licks his lips] Sounds great! [spits more ice cream at Plankton when talking]
Plankton: Wonderful. [laughs evilly then SpongeBob joins in the laughing. Then an adult fish sits on SpongeBob] SpongeBob, don't let that guy sit on you! Assertiveness lesson #1: tell him to get off!
SpongeBob: Umm, excuse me, sir, you're sitting on my body, which is also my face.
Plankton: No, no, be assertive! [SpongeBob puts his fingers in the guy's pockets]
SpongeBob: Beep Beep! [Plankton facepalms]
Plankton: Not in-sertive! [adult fish checks his watch, then walks away] SpongeBob, you missed your chance! You've got to be aggressive to get the things you want! You're too soft!
SpongeBob: But I'm a spo...
Plankton: Don't say it! [Plankton spots the eel that took SpongeBob's ice cream] There's the guy who took your ice cream. Don't you want it back?
SpongeBob: Ice cream! [Plankton gets up and runs behind Electric Eel]
Plankton: Listen, you! My friend's got something to say! [Electric Eel turns around]
Eel: What, who said that? [talks to SpongeBob] Was it you?
Plankton: Tell him off, SpongeBob. Assert yourself!
SpongeBob: That's my ice cream cone!
Plankton: Great! Now let him have it!
SpongeBob: [misunderstanding what Plankton means] You can have it.
Eel: Say, thanks! [walks off]
Plankton: No! [jumps inside SpongeBob's mouth] I'll show ya how! [voicing for SpongeBob, SpongeBob stands still.] Hey, pencil neck! [Electric Eel turns around] Yeah, you. Slither over here! [Electric Eel walks over to SpongeBob] Surrender that ice cream cone, or every waking moment for you will become a swirling torrent of pain and misery! [Electric Eel looks scared; he throws the ice cream onto SpongeBob's face and runs away crying]
SpongeBob: Hey, that guy was crying!
Plankton: Those were tears of joy! He was happy that you were assertive!
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Plankton: You see how wonderful life can be, when you're maniacal?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I thought it was called assertive.
Plankton: Whatever.
SpongeBob: Well, if it got me this ice cream, then I like it! [throws ice cream on his tongue, hitting Plankton who is still on it. Later, he is using a metal detector, and it beeps] I found something!
Scooter Like Fish: Uhh, excuse me, my metal detector broke. Can I use yours? [SpongeBob hands the equipment to him]
SpongeBob: Sure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, this is your next lesson. Be aggressive! Tell that guy to take a hike!
SpongeBob: [misunderstands] Do you want to take a hike with me?
Scooter Like Fish: Yeah.
Plankton: [angry] Now, look what you've done! Tell that guy to go fall in a ditch!
SpongeBob: [sees a ditch] Hey, go check in that ditch! [points to the ditch beside them. The fish jumps down in the ditch and finds a treasure chest]
Scooter Like Fish: Wow, buried treasure! Thanks!
SpongeBob: Did you see that, Plankton? That guy found some buried treasure!
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get it right! Tell that guy you know karate and you'll tie him in a knot if you don't get your metal detector back!
SpongeBob: Hey! I'm gonna tie your shoe if you don't give that back!
Fish: But I'm wearing sandals!
SpongeBob: Okay, never mind! [Plankton jumps off of SpongeBob] It's alright, Plankton, he's wearing sandals. What's the matter?
Plankton: [putting things into a suitcase] Oh, nothing, SpongeBob. [puts on a black hat] I was just beginning to think that this was a waste of time.
SpongeBob: No it's not!
Plankton: Forget it! I guess you don't have what it takes to be a stand-up guy.
SpongeBob: But what about airline food?
Plankton: What?
SpongeBob: Airline food. My gosh, what is up with that stuff? Thank you, good night! [rimshot] See, I can be a stand-up guy. See? [Plankton throws his hat down]
Plankton: SpongeBob, you'll never get what you want! You'll always let people step all over you! You're just like stairs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Plankton, give me another chance!
Plankton: Okay, but this is your last chance! [points to people trying to get a tan] Look at all those beach hogs soaking up your sun rays. Do you have what it takes to get a tan?
SpongeBob: Just watch me! [runs over and waves a blanket up and down and builds up sand to make the beach-goers run away] Man, this thing is sandy!
Fred: My leg! [after everyone runs off, SpongeBob is laying on his back with a funnel acting as a sunlamp]
Plankton: Yes, my plan is beginning to work! They're leaving the beach! [SpongeBob now has a tan and looks brown] SpongeBob, that was wonderful! Is that an all-over tan?
SpongeBob: Well, not all of me.
Hot Dog Man: Hot dogs! Hot dogs!
Plankton: Look at that huge line at the hot dog stand. Assert yourself to the front!
SpongeBob: I'll do better than that! [he stretches his tongue to eat everybody's hotdogs]
Plankton: SpongeBob, that was genius! Look at all those kite fliers blocking your view!
SpongeBob: What?
Plankton: Breaking your wind! [SpongeBob uses one of his teeth to boomerang it into cutting the strings off the kites]
Larry: Hey, SpongeBob, throw us the ball. [SpongeBob pops the volleyball and trumpets like an elephant. Everybody leaves the beach]
SpongeBob: Plankton, did you see that? I was a regular alpha-male! [sees Plankton missing] Plankton? [Plankton is driving a crane] Plankton, all my asserting is driving everybody away!
Plankton: Exactly.
SpongeBob: You didn't tell me everyone would leave.
Plankton: Oops. [he presses a button in his crane, and the "Mega Bucket" sign comes out from the ground]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Mega Bucket?! You used me... for land development! [voice cracks] That wasn't nice!
Plankton: Haven't you figured it out, SpongeBob? Nice guys finish last. Only aggressive people conquer the world! [laughs evilly]
SpongeBob: Well, what about aggressively nice people?
Plankton: Huh? What are you doing? [SpongeBob brings out the hot dogs he ate earlier and puts them back where they belong. Then he puts the kites back where they were] Wait, SpongeBob! Stop! [a girl is crying because she has sand on her ice cream. SpongeBob takes it and wipes the sand off with his eyelashes] Butterfly kisses. Can't take it. It's too cute! It's... it's disgusting! [Scooter is crying at his broken surfboard]
SpongeBob: What happened? [points to surfboard]
Scooter: I hit a reef with my new board, dude!
SpongeBob: No problem! [makes himself a surfboard]
Scooter: Whoa! [grabs the surfboard] Killer!
Plankton: SpongeBob, stop! Before it's too late! Your kindness is bringing everybody back! Get back! [everyone comes back] Wait! [everyone steps on Plankton. He is squished. Scooter is surfing]
Scooter: Cowabunga! Thanks, dude! That was awesome!
SpongeBob: Gee, Plankton, I'm sorry about the Chum Bucket.
Plankton: Forget about that. I just can't take so much kindness in one sitting! [bunches up into a ball] Need hatred. [crawls away]
SpongeBob: Volleyball, anyone? [everyone uses SpongeBob as the ball] Serve up! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! Aaa! Ouch! 
[the episode begins with Gary snoring and meowing]
SpongeBob: Wake up, Gary.
Gary: [wakes up] Meow?
SpongeBob: We're moving today!
Gary: [quizzically] Meow?
SpongeBob: That's right! We're leaving home. We're going to become peasants! [puts on a hat and fake beard]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [He takes away Gary's bowl] No more food. [gives Gary a plate with clams on it] Sorry, Gary. Peasants only eat mashed-up clamshells. [SpongeBob puts salt in the shells, and Gary starts crying] April Fools! [takes off the outfit and puts Gary's food bowl back onto the floor] There ya go, pal!
Gary: Meow. [eats]
SpongeBob: [goes into the kitchen] Whew, I'm thirsty! [takes a big glass of lemonade out of the fridge] [deep voice] This is an extreme thirst! [sets the lemonade down on the floor; bubble transition to him putting all the lemonade into a lot of small glasses with umbrellas]
SpongeBob: [normal voice] Whew, I'm exhausted. I sure can't wait to drink all of these drinks! April Fools! [holds up a mirror] To me! [laughs obnoxiously and walks outside and towards work. Squidward sees him]
Squidward: What's he so happy about? [walks by the calendar and notices it's April Fools Day. He panics] April 1st? [screams] April Fools Day is SpongeBob's favorite holiday! [puts a heating pad on his head and dials the number for the Krusty Krab] Mr. Krabs, I can't come in today. I caught something terrible.
Mr. Krabs: [over phone] What'd you catch?
Squidward: I caught sight of the calendar.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, hold on, Squidward, there's someone here to see you. He says he's from the Barnacle Bay Art Museum and he wants to honor you as artist of the month.
[Squidward runs to the Krusty Krab with an artist uniform on]
Squidward: I have arrived. [SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh] What's so funny? Where's the art dealer?
[SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs laugh more]
Mr. Krabs: You just missed him.
SpongeBob: Yeah, but he told us to tell you...
Squidward: Tell me what?
SpongeBob: [whispers into Squidward's ear] He told me to tell you... April Fools.
Squidward: [lays his hat on the table] Well, it's been nice working here. [he walks off] Thanks for everything, Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Squidward, wait!
Squidward: Just send my last check to the P.O. box, Mr. Krabs!
SpongeBob: Wait, Squidward! [grabs Squidward's legs] It was just a joke! No more jokes on you today, I promise!
Squidward: You do?
SpongeBob: Sure, there are lots of other willing participants. Right, Mr. Krabs?
[Mr. Krabs sits on a whoopee cushion and it "farts." SpongeBob laughs]
Squidward: Well, as long as it's not me.
[bubble transition to SpongeBob carrying a tray of burger patties when an old lady comes by]
Cora: Excuse me, could you tell me where the forks are?
SpongeBob: They're right here, lady! [leads her to the utensils]
Cora: [picks up a spoon] But this is a spoon.
SpongeBob: April Fools! [laughs; Squidward stares at SpongeBob and he runs away; bubble transition to SpongeBob behind the register; a customer comes up to him] Welcome to the Krusty Krab. How may I help you?
Nat: [raises up his left arm] Yeah, give me two large fries and a Jumbo Krabby Patty.
SpongeBob: [points at something] Hey, what's that?
[Nat turns around; SpongeBob turns around and has a smiley face on his back]
Nat: Well, I didn't see anything. [notices that SpongeBob is gone] Hey, where'd that other guy go?
[SpongeBob turns around]
SpongeBob: April Fools! I'm right here!
Nat: [laughs] Hey, that was pretty good.
[SpongeBob laughs obnoxiously; Squidward notices SpongeBob behind the register]
Squidward: What are you doing behind the counter?
[Bubble transition to SpongeBob wiping the floor; Tom comes by with a cup of soda]
Tom: Excuse me, can I get a couple of ice cubes in here, please?
SpongeBob: Sure! A couple of ice cubes coming up! [fills the cup with ice and comes back whistling] Here you go.
Tom: Thanks. [he takes a sip of his drink; SpongeBob titters and Tom looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before Tom turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom takes another sip of his drink; SpongeBob starts giggling again and then Tom turns around and looks at him, but SpongeBob stops before he turns around] Huh? [SpongeBob is silent, so Tom finishes his drink] Ah.
SpongeBob: [laughs loudly and obnoxiously] April Fools! [Tom grabs SpongeBob by the collar, suddenly panicked]
Tom: What did you do to my drink?!
SpongeBob: I... [giggles] I... [giggles]
Tom: You what?!?!
SpongeBob: You asked for a couple of ice cubes in your drink, and I only put in one! [laughs]
Tom: I guess that is pretty funny. [laughs as he walks off]
SpongeBob: [laughs so hard his tongue pops off] Hey, your shoes untied. [tongue looks down] April Fools! You're not wearing shoes! [laughs and hugs his tongue, which smiles. Then they laugh into the microphone; everyone hears it; in the kitchen, Squidward tries to mute the sound with tissues, but he can still hear it] April Fools! [Squidward drops a plate]
Squidward: That does it! SpongeBob and his stupid pranks! I'm going to show him what a real prank is all about! [bubble transition to him squirting some mustard inside a rope circle then he chuckles and shows SpongeBob the mess]
SpongeBob: Oh, boy! Something for me to clean up! [starts cleaning it and Squidward is standing next to a rope which he is about to cut]
Squidward: April Fools! [laughs as he cuts the rope which grabs SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Whooaahh! [the rope sends him into a bag of flour. Squidward is laughing through all of this. Then SpongeBob is taken around a bar] Whoa! Blblblblblblblblblblblbl... [screams as he is sent slamming face-first into the wall]
Customers: Oh, no!
[Squidwards eyes pop out as he laughs hysterically. SpongeBob screams and flies into Bubble Bass' rear]
SpongeBob: Whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [Cut to Squidward cheerleading, laughing, and jumping into the air. Then SpongeBob smashes into the ceiling]
Squidward: [runs and holds out his arms to catch SpongeBob] I'll catch you, SpongeBob! [he giggles to himself. SpongeBob screams as he plummets toward Squidward, who quickly sets out a garbage can in front of him, and SpongeBob falls into the goop in the can] Oops. [dumps SpongeBob, who is now the shape of the can, out of the garbage can] April Fools, you little sausage! [he laughs; SpongeBob sobs hysterically and runs out of the Krusty Krab] SpongeBob! I was just kidding! C'mon, c'mon. You all know I was just kidding… Right?
Martin: Aww, man, poor kid.
Shubie: That guy has definitely got some issues to work out. [The customers glare at Squidward as they begin to leave]
Tom: April Fools... jerk. [All the customers storm out the door in disgust]
Squidward: Wait, don't go!
Man: Hey, you stink!
Squidward: Wait, wait, it was a joke! Uh huh... [looks around at the mess he has made and winces, then he looks at Bubble Bass, who has a hole in his bottom due to the "prank" and Squidward starts to feel ashamed of himself] Why is it whenever I'm having fun, it's wrong? I didn't mean to make him cry. I guess this means I'd better tell SpongeBob I'm sor-eaach. [makes silly face] Huh? I guess this means I'd better apolo- [throat goes haywire] gii! This is gonna be tougher than I thought. [bubble transition to Squidward going to SpongeBob's pineapple; he knocks on SpongeBob's door] SpongeBob? Uh, SpongeBob, come out! I've got something to tell you! SpongeBob? [notices a Krusty Krab hat and goes over there to talk to the man who is wearing it] Uhh, I was thinking about today and uh… and it just seems that I may owe you some sort of… This isn't something I normally do, so, listen carefully SpongeBob, because I am about to tell you that I am... [notices that the guy with the hat on is Patrick] Patrick? What are you doing here?
Patrick: Digging.
Squidward: Why are you wearing that hat?
Patrick: Hmm, I don't know. [takes off the hat]
Squidward: [growls] Where's SpongeBob?
Patrick: He's in the house. He's impressed.
Squidward: With what?
Patrick: I don't know, but it must've been pretty good to make him cry like that.
Squidward: [shivers then goes back to SpongeBob's house] SpongeBob, SpongeBob, let me in there! [tries to turn the handle, but SpongeBob's arm comes from under the door and pulls it inside; Squidward grabs his clarinet] SpongeBob, you'd better let me in there! I don't want to have to use this! [plays clarinet horribly. SpongeBob opens the door]
SpongeBob: What do you want?
Squidward: SpongeBob, I just wanted to say that I'm sorr-yyyy. [sticks out tongue while talking]
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: I'm trying to say I'm [turns into a donkey and starts braying] hee-haw-hee-haw!
SpongeBob: What?
Squidward: I'm just trying to say that I'm... [head explodes] There's gotta be an easier way to do this. [bubble transition to Squidward writing a note; he puts it in a bottle and rolls it to SpongeBob where he picks it up] Well, aren't you going to open it?
SpongeBob: I can't. I don't have a bottle opener.
Squidward: Doh! [Squidward hands SpongeBob a can and Squidward drives to the other side of the road] SpongeBob, I'm... [whispers into the can, then puts the can up to his ear but hears some sort of noise; Patrick is flossing his teeth with the cord; Squidward growls and throws the binoculars down on the ground] SpongeBob, all I am trying to say is that I am... [waves tentacles in the air and bubbles form, puts a big bubble on his head and then talks] ...sorry. [pops the bubble] There you go.
SpongeBob: But I couldn't... [Squidward slams the door in his face]
Squidward: I don't care! I said it! My conscience is clear! [Starts to walk away, when an image of Patrick appears in the air]
Patrick: Must've been pretty good to make him cry like that. [Squidward nervously continues walking and runs into a ghost image of a guy at the Krusty Krab]
Tom: April Fools... jerk. [Squidward frantically starts running again, but this time his mother appears]
Mama Tentacles: [male voice] You stink!
Squidward: Mother? [runs back to SpongeBob's house to apologize] All right, all right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I admit it, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you, in fact, SpongeBob, I like you! I like living next door, I like hearing your foghorn alarm in the morning and your high-pitched giggling at night! I also like Gary, Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and all the other people I'm forced to be in contact with! And, and, and... [SpongeBob opens the door slightly]
SpongeBob: Squidward! Is all that true?
Squidward: Yes, SpongeBob. Yes, it's all true.
SpongeBob: Even the part about the lima beans and the car chase?
Squidward: What the...? Yes, whatever! But you have to promise not to tell anybody.
SpongeBob: I promise.
Squidward: Really? [SpongeBob opens the door all the way, revealing the citizens of Bikini Bottom inside]
Everyone: April Fools!
Squidward: [twitches eye] April Fools! You're right, April Fools! I just fooled you all! [laughs hysterically while going back into his house]
SpongeBob: What would we do without Squidward? 
[SpongeBob Patrick are browsing through Fry Cook Museum making noises at every rare item they see]
SpongeBob: Behold the ultimate cooking utensil, the golden spatula! [Larry tries to pull the spatula out]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, look what it says here. [reads plaque] Many have tried to pull the spatula from this ancient grease, but all have failed.
Larry: [Makes a straining noise after the golden spatula springs back.]
SpongeBob: Only a fry cook worthy of King Neptune himself can wield...
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...the golden spatula. Wow!
SpongeBob: Oh, oh, oh, oh! Take a picture of me and the spatula! [SpongeBob runs up to the spatula and holds it] Okay, I'm ready! [Patrick is about to take a picture]
Miss Shell: Excuse me, do you know where the menu section is? [Patrick gets confused and drools]
Patrick: Uh!
SpongeBob: Menu section? That's easy, it's over that way. [SpongeBob pulls the spatula out and gray clouds appear above him] Uh-oh.
Miss Shell: [deep voice] Holy smokes! [runs away]
Patrick: Rude. Hey, the light changed.
SpongeBob: Uhh, Patrick...
Patrick: [lightning bolts strike] Hold on, almost there. [clouds open to a mysterious figure comes out that is known as]
King Neptune: Yes, yes, at last! Someone worthy of being the royal fry cook. Who has freed the spatula from the grease?
SpongeBob: Uhh, I did, Mr. Neptune, sir. SpongeBob SquarePants.
King Neptune: A fine jest, boy. You are but a lowly yellow sponge. [SpongeBob goes droopy each time he is insulted] Puny, insignificant, a commoner. Therefore, you could never be fry cook to a god and this is why it is funny! [laughs] Now step aside as I seek out the true fry cook. [searches for the real spatula taker] No, no. Mmm-hmm, you're too short, no... [soon comes up to a hot dog stand] Ah!
SpongeBob: But, but...
King Neptune: A purveyor of foods. [chuckles] Yes, you must be my new fry cook.
Hot Dog Vendor: Uhh, sorry, King Neptune. I don't make them. I just sell them.
King Neptune: Then who pulled out the spatula?
Hot Dog Vendor: [scoffs at Neptune] Uh, he did. [points to SpongeBob]
King Neptune: [everyone laughs] It is even funnier a second time! [destroys the hot dog stand with his fist] You there, crustacean!
Larry: Who, me?
King Neptune: You have the physique of Atlas!
Larry: [laughs] Thanks, I work out.
King Neptune: [laughs] Make poses with me!
Larry: Okay!
Larry and King Neptune: [show off their muscles] Body slam! [body slams each other]
King Neptune: You pulled the spatula from the grease!
Larry: Nope, that was SpongeBob.
[SpongeBob smiles]
King Neptune: This joke has gone far enough! Where's my fry cook? [everyone runs except Patrick] Certainly you with your prodigious girth would know who can flip a burger to suit a royal palate! [Patrick points to SpongeBob] What? Am I expected to believe this creature is royal fry cook material? I don't suppose you have any proof? [Patrick shows the photo he took of SpongeBob holding the spatula] Ha! This thing is unfit to even scrub the royal tail fin! And besides, it's not just enough to pull a spatula from a greasy griddle. There are certain qualities that a royal fry cook must have.
SpongeBob: Like?
King Neptune: The royal fry cook must be, you know, left-handed.
SpongeBob: Actually, I've got two. [shows two left hands]
King Neptune: [snaps fingers] Also, the royal fry cook wears red underwear. [SpongeBob shows his red underwear] No, blue. [SpongeBob shows his blue underwear] Uh, the royal fry cook's wallet contains... [SpongeBob takes out his wallet] His big toes are... [SpongeBob gets ready to show something about his foot] Uhh, he has six...
Patrick: [contemptuously mocks Neptune] He is the new royal fry cook and you...
King Neptune: [shouting] Silence! [Patrick gets zapped]
Patrick: Is it hot in here or what? [falls over]
SpongeBob: [gasp] Patrick! You hurt my friend! You're not a king, you're a bully and a liar!
King Neptune: [grabs SpongeBob] So, little one, you think you have what it takes to become my royal fry cook? I will prove your worthlessness. You shall be tested with a challenge!
Patrick: [faint, down below] [mocks Neptune again] Bring it on! SpongeBob can handle any... [Patrick gets zapped again] Ouch.
King Neptune: Your friend's arrogance will cost you dearly. There will be two challenges.
Patrick: [mocks Neptune again] Only two? What are two challenges to someone like SpongeBob? [Patrick gets zapped again]
King Neptune: Three challenges!
Patrick: Three? [laughs contemptuously] [mocks Neptune with sarcasm] Three challenges is nothing. Might as well make it 500 challenges! [Patrick gets zapped again]
King Neptune: Enough! [Patrick gets zapped into a dust pile]
Patrick: He'll settle for one.
King Neptune: There will be but one challenge. You will face me in: The Ultimate Cook-Off!
SpongeBob: I will accept your challenge if you fix my friend.
King Neptune: Ah, yes, the round one. I shall restore him. [Patrick gets zapped to normal]
Patrick: SpongeBob? SpongeBob?! [turns around as we see that his face is now on the bottom of his body above his legs] SpongeBob? Oh, there you are!
SpongeBob: How you feeling?
Patrick: Pretty good. Say, have you gotten taller?
King Neptune: And now, see the fate that may lie ahead. [summons the clouds] For if some minute chance you meet the challenge, your reward will be great. [opens the clouds] Behold! [shows Tom Kenny taking a shower and he screams; Neptune quickly closes the portal and blushes] Hehe. Whoopsie! Now, behold! [opens the clouds again and shows the city of Atlantis] My beloved home of Atlantis. A prize worthy of Apollo. You will reside here in this glorious palace, cook only for me, and be a god!
Patrick: Hey, that sounds pretty good.
King Neptune: But if you should not succeed, you must give up fry cooking forever! What do you say?
SpongeBob: I'm ready.
King Neptune: Very well then. To the Poseidome! [At the Poseidome]
Mr. Krabs: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ultimate Cook-Off! [Everyone cheers] All right, mates. First to a thousand patties wins. Shake hands.[King Neptune and SpongeBob shake hands. SpongeBob's arm disintegrates]
SpongeBob: [regrows his hand] May the best man win.
Mr. Krabs: Go back to your corners and when the bell sounds, come out cooking! [talking to SpongeBob] Don't worry, lad, I have total confidence in you. [Mr. Krabs has a lot of money in his hands] Put it all on Neptune!
SpongeBob: I'm not good enough to cook in Atlantis, Patrick. I should have never taken the challenge.
Patrick: Don't give up on your dream, SpongeBob! People used to tell me: "Patrick, you'll never amount to anything. You'll always have your head in the clouds." Well, just look at me now. [bell dings] Go get 'em, tiger! [King Neptune starts making his Krabby Patties and so does SpongeBob.]
[King Neptune makes his very quickly with help from sea creatures and his magic. SpongeBob takes his time going through each important step to make sure his patty comes out right. King Neptune summons large amounts of wheat from the ground and zaps them into buns.]
[King Neptune summons the vegetables, and summons the swordfish to slice them all. SpongeBob makes sure a tomato is perfectly aligned. He carefully slices the tomato with the golden spatula.]
[King Neptune zaps the patties, while SpongeBob rubs sticks to create a fire. King Neptune uses magic to flip hundreds of patties. SpongeBob patiently waits for the patty to cook above the campfire.]
[King Neptune uses magic to assemble the hundreds of burgers that appear like Krabby Patties. King Neptune laughs while the burgers rain down. SpongeBob puts ketchup on two pickles to apply faces on them. He applies a cheese "blanket," kisses a pickle.]
SpongeBob: [reading a bedtime story to the pickles] Once upon a time...
[King Neptune still laughs, while the burgers assemble in a square-based pyramid. SpongeBob puts the top bun on his one Krabby Patty.]
SpongeBob: Perfect!
[In the end, the score is King Neptune: 1000 and SpongeBob: 1]
King Neptune: I win! [everyone cheers but SpongeBob] Loser! [Chuckles] Free patties for everyone! [everyone chews a bite out of the patties that King Neptune made and they spit it out immediately] Fools! Have you no taste buds? There's nothing wrong with these, they're delicious! [sniffs one] Ooh.
Audience: [Everyone complains different complaints that King Neptune needs to try one of his burgers] You can eat it all, come one! Chew it! Why don't you eat it? Try it! Eat it! Eat it!
King Neptune: [throws his burger out] Okay, mine's no good. But what makes you think his will be any better? [King Neptune grabs a patty from SpongeBob] Give me that! [King Neptune eats it and begins to like it] Mmmm. Why it tastes so good, I think I'd like to try it a second time! [King Neptune spits it out and eats it again; the crowd groans in disgust.]
SpongeBob: So, uhh, what do you think?
King Neptune: Yours is superior. Therefore, I concede to you, SpongeBob SquarePants, you win. [everyone cheers]
SpongeBob & Patrick: Yeah! [both dancing] We're going to Atlantis! We're going to Atlantis! [King Neptune laughs]
SpongeBob: What's so funny?
King Neptune: You, SpongeBob. That repulsive thing in my palace?
SpongeBob: You mean, Patrick can't come?
King Neptune: [laughs] No, of course not.
SpongeBob: And my friends?
King Neptune: Ah, the only friend you need, dear boy, is the royal grill.
Patrick: [crying and wiping his tears with a tissue] It was nice knowing you, buddy!
SpongeBob: [Mr Krabs cries] I know, Mr. Krabs, I'll miss you, too.
Mr. Krabs: I lost me bet!
King Neptune: Come, SpongeBob, grab your things! It's time to depart... [a two-seater bike appears] to Atlantis![rings bell]
SpongeBob: I... I... [cries] I don't wanna go!
King Neptune: It's too late now. I can't live without your burgers. You're going to be a god and like it! [King Neptune zaps SpongeBob and he becomes a muscular god. But being the same size, he looks a little strange] Maybe we do have a problem.
SpongeBob: [in a booming voice] Wait, Neptune! I have another idea! [Patrick walks in the Krusty Krab still looking the same when King Neptune changed him back to normal but with his face on the bottom]
Patrick: Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. What'll you have? [Patrick drools stupidly then SpongeBob hears King Neptune shout] Can you excuse me?
King Neptune: The accursed stove has burnt my finger. Feel thine own wrath, stove! [uses his powers to zap the stove] Haha!
SpongeBob: What did I tell you about using your powers, trainee?
King Neptune: [Sighs. Embarrassedly puts arms behind his back.] Uh... Perfect patties are made with love, not magic. [SpongeBob smiles] 
Narrator: Fishermen have quite an effect on our undersea friends. [shows fishermen in boats fishing near the Bikini Bottom atoll]
Squidward: SpongeBob, have you finished swabbing the deck?
SpongeBob: Almost. There's a nasty barnacle under table nine. [uses himself as a cleaning tool]
Mr. Krabs: They're back! They're back I tell ya! I saw it with me own eyes! [everyone looks at Mr. Krabs like he's crazy] The hooks! The hooks!
Fred: How about a mint?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! The hooks!
Tom: Can you make that to go?
Squidward: [gives Tom his food in a bag] You don't know how lucky you are.
Mr. Krabs: The hooks. So there I was, minding my own business...
Squidward: I'd love to hear another of your riveting sea tales, but, um... I have to do my waste basket inspection. [puts a trashcan on his head] Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. There's one.
Mr. Krabs: Fine. Don't say I didn't warn ya.
SpongeBob: Warn him about what, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: The hooks, me bucko. They're back. Beware the hooks.
SpongeBob: The hooks?
Mr. Krabs: Aye. [shapes his arm like a hook as SpongeBob looks at his arm] The hooks. [The camera shows SpongeBob's face with a reflection with Mr. Krabs' arm as a hook] They dangle down and draw you close with their pleasing shapes and their beguiling colors. And just when you think you found the land of milk and honey, they grab you by the britches... [grabs Scooter's pants and lifts high like he is giving him a wedgie. His drink decreases every time Mr. Krabs grabs his pants as he sips it] ...and haul you way up high. Then higher, and higher, and higher [he opens a hatch on the roof and points at the surface] until you're hauled up to the surface, flopping and gasping for breath. And then, they cook ya, and then, they eat ya, or worse...
SpongeBob: [gasps] What could be worse than that?
Mr. Krabs: Gift shops. [shows gift shop and the inside of the gift shop]
SpongeBob: [gasps and hides under a box] Don't let 'em get me, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. They won't get ya. Not as long as you listen to ol' Mr. Krabs. Now get back to the kitchen. Time is money.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, Mr. Krabs. [goes in the kitchen with the box on him]
Patrick: [pokes his head through one of the kitchen windows] Good morning, Krusty Krew.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick.
Patrick: Guess what? The carnival's in town. Come on, let's go.
SpongeBob: I can't leave now. I'm working.
Patrick: It's not leaving. You're just taking a break. [SpongeBob goes outside behind unseen] We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carni... [trips and falls on face] We're going to the carnival. We're going to the carnival. There it is, SpongeBob. The carnival is back in town. [many hooks are dangling] I'm gonna be first in line for everything!
SpongeBob: Where is everybody?
Patrick: I don't know. There was one kid here, earlier. [a pair of kids' sneakers lie on the ground nearby]
SpongeBob: Doesn't look like any carnival I ever... [bumps into a hook] Excuse me. [gasps as he sees the hook as the camera shows SpongeBob's face again with the reflection with a hook] Stop, Patrick! Don't touch it! This isn't the carnival, Patrick. Those are hooks. Mr. Krabs says they're really dangerous!
Patrick: [sits on a hook] Hmmm. I sense no danger here. How can they be dangerous? They're covered with free cheese!
SpongeBob: All I know is Mr. Krabs said-- Patrick, don't do that!
[Patrick is putting the cheese in his mouth]
Patrick: Cheesy. No danger here. Go on, try it. [the hook where Patrick ate the cheese from is pulled up]
SpongeBob: [faces another hook with cheese attached to it] But, Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: SpongeBob, let me ask you something. [the hook that SpongeBob is facing is pulled up. Patrick is shown with 9 hooks in his mouth and still has 1 in his hand] Does this look dangerous?
SpongeBob: [screams] Patrick, don't!
Patrick: Lighten up, will ya? Or do I have to eat all this cheese by mysel... [hooks pulls him up]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Patrick! Help! Oh, Patrick, help! Oh, Patrick, come back. Oh, my best friend. [Patrick floats down and SpongeBob runs into him as he hits the ground] Patrick, you're alive.
Patrick: Am I ever. You should try it.
SpongeBob: But...what about the surface, and your britches, and the gift shops?
Patrick: You just jump off before you go up too high.
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs said I shouldn't get near those things.
Patrick: Did he say you shouldn't climb on top of them and ride them like a horsey? [he jumps on a fish-like attachment on the hook]
SpongeBob: Well, no.
Patrick: Wheeee.
SpongeBob: I guess he didn't. [he jumps on the attachment with Patrick]
Patrick: Hi Ho, Silverfish. Away! [The hook pulls them up. We see a fisherman reeling in his fishing rod. We see SpongeBob and Patrick laughing out of enjoyment. The camera alternates between the fisherman to SpongeBob and Patrick. After a few cuts, SpongeBob and Patrick are about to jump off]
SpongeBob: Ready?
Patrick: Ready.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Geronimo! [jump off]
SpongeBob: This is more fun than double overtime at the Krusty Krab. [We cut to the exterior at the Krusty Krab when customers are muttering angrily. We cut to see Ivy mad with Harold]
Ivy: P.U., [points at his Krabby Patty] you call this food?!
Harold: My sandwich tastes like a fried boot!
Another Harold: [Starts holding up his fried boot] My sandwich is a fried boot!
Fred: Hurry it up, will ya? We're hungry over here. Look at us. My kids haven't eaten in three days and I'm dying. That's not how you're supposed to flip it. [customers muttering angrily... all talking at once; Squidward frantically flipping burnt patties]
Squidward: [defensive] Why do you wanna eat this stuff anyway?!
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, what the halibut is going on in here?
Squidward: It's a feeding frenzy, sir. And SpongeBob's not back from his break. [Mr. Krabs laughs] What?
Mr. Krabs: I thought you said SpongeBob was taking a break. No one's taken a break at the Krusty Krab since the Chum Famine of '59. [laughs] Now, what were you saying?
Squidward: He took a break.
Mr. Krabs: [stares in shocked silence, as his arms and nose fall off. He then storms out the front door] Alright, SpongeBob LazyPants, I'll find ya. This nose can smell laziness up to 10,000 leagues. [uses his nose to smell] Aha! I'll give you a break you'll not soon forget.
Squidward: But, Mr. Krabs, I still need help! [all the customers pick up Squidward like they are a mob]
Mr. Krabs: [uses his nose to smell again] They should be right here. [SpongeBob & Patrick float down as they are laughing]
Patrick: Again?
SpongeBob: Again!
Mr. Krabs: The hooks! No! No! No!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [pulling on hook] 1, 2, 3...
Mr. Krabs : Wait! Wait!
SpongeBob and Patrick: ...blastoff. [hook pulls them up as Mr. Krabs slams into a rock]
Mr. Krabs: Boys. I wasn't quick enough. They're gone! [sobs] If I can only hold them in me arms again, I'd...I'd... [SpongeBob and Patrick float back down while laughing] ...I'd throttle 'em! What did I tell you about those hooks, boy?!
SpongeBob: I...I...I...
Patrick: I'll tell you about the hooks. You ride em up, and up, and up, then you gently flow down.
Mr. Krabs: And do you know what happens when you don't float back down?
SpongeBob: Gift shop?
Mr. Krabs: Worse! You end up vacuum-packed in a can of tuna. [shows a can of tuna] With nothing to look forward to but the smell of mayonnaise! [shows a jar of mayo while a female screams in the background]
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're sorry, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I want you boys to promise me you'll never go on those hooks again.
SpongeBob & Patrick: [raises hands] We promise, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I need a sailors promise. Repeat after me: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks I'll never go.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Yo-ho, yo-ho, near the hooks we'll never go.
[a hook pokes Mr. Krabs in the butt]
Mr. Krabs: [leaps up, holding his injured rear] Yow! Mother of pearl! Fire on the poop deck!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahh! Mother of pearl. Fire on the poop deck. [they turn and rub their own behinds]
Mr. Krabs: Whoa. Whew. Alright then. Let's get out of this death trap. [Cuts to the exterior of SpongeBob's house]
SpongeBob: Okay, Gary. Today is a new day. I'm ready to prove myself loyal to Mr. Krabs.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: I'm ready! [comes running out of the house] I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready, ready, ready. I'm ready. [Patrick comes out from his rock]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, you're going the wrong way. [crashes into his furniture]
SpongeBob: I always go to work this way.
Patrick: You're not going to work today. We're going to go play hooky!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, we promised.
Patrick: Well, I had my fingers crossed.
SpongeBob: You don't have any fingers, Patrick.
Patrick: Well, that Mr. Krabs is just a big dummy. We played on those hooks all day long and nothing happened to us.
SpongeBob: But Mr. Krabs said...
Patrick: Look, SpongeBob, are you gonna listen to a big dummy, or are you gonna listen to me?
SpongeBob: Umm...
Patrick: See ya later, SpongeBob. I'm gonna go have some fun. [Patrick goes up and down the hooks] Come on, SpongeBob. You know you want to!
SpongeBob: Ooh, I know I want to, but I promised Mr. Krabs I wouldn't go near another... [almost runs into a hook. Gasps] ...hook! [almost touches the hook but takes it back] Oh no! Mr. Krabs told me all about you. You are a liar! A deceiver! I'll never fall for your tricks again! Never! [goes back to hook] Is this seat taken? [hook takes him up, but when he comes down and turns around, it is shown that he is hooked at the pants] Whew! Glad I got that out of my system. [gasps] I'm...hooked! And that means... [shows the tuna can with SpongeBob crammed inside] Help! I'm hooked! Help! Mr. Krabs! Help! It happened! I'm hooked! Oh, no! The hook! The hook! Gift shop, tuna can, mayonnaise!
Mr. Krabs: Here you go, Pearl. Free water for all your little friends.
Pearl: Thanks, dad.
Mr. Krabs: Just don't forget to leave a tip for ol' Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: Psst, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're two minutes late. What kept you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Um, you know those hooks we were talking about yesterday?
Mr. Krabs: Didn't I tell you not to go near those hooks?
SpongeBob: Umm...no. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes, yes, you told me not to go near them.
Mr. Krabs: Well, you weren't playing on those hooks, were you, laddie?
SpongeBob: Of course not. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean, not exactly. [hook pulls him a little closer] I mean yes! Yes I did it! I admit it! [cries] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'm so ashamed! I mean, look at me! I'm hooked! [shows the hook to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Hmmm, it's in there pretty deep.
SpongeBob: What am I gonna do?
Mr. Krabs: There's only one thing to do, boy. [group of girls laugh. SpongeBob looks at his pants]
SpongeBob: Oh no, Mr. Krabs. I can't take off my pants. Not in front of all these girls. [hook pulls him closer] D’oh, okay. I'm taking em off. I'm taking 'em off. [takes pants off] There.
Mr. Krabs: Uhh... lad?
SpongeBob: [screams] Oh no. Oh no, no, no, Mr. Krabs. I can't do it! Anything but that!
Mr. Krabs: I understand. You were a good little fry cook, SpongeBob. [he places a "Help Wanted" sign on the door] But, we'll find another. Hopefully one that will listen to ol Mr. Krabs.
SpongeBob: [hook pulls him a little closer] Oh, Mr. Krabs! I'll listen! I promise. [He holds on to a flower but the hook pulls him away. He holds on to the Krusty Krab signpost] Please save me, Mr. Krabs! [cries] I promise I'll be good! [underwear tears off] Whew. [the signpost flings him into the door naked, which makes the girls laugh]
Girls: Ooh, look! [laughs]
Pearl: It's SpongeBob NudeyPants! [SpongeBob screams and runs]
Squidward: [holding a fishing hook with SpongeBob's underwear on the hook] Well, that was more of SpongeBob than I needed to see.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, that was some fine angling. Do you think the lad has learned his lesson?
Squidward: Oh, I think he'll remember this for a long time. I know I will. [both laugh. Shows SpongeBob running back to his house]
SpongeBob: The pants! The underwear! [cries]
Patrick: [bus drops off a can of tuna] Hello? Does somebody have a can opener? 
[The exterior of SpongeBob's pineapple is shown.]
French Narrator: Ah, [The scene pan-fades into the house.] Saturday morning in Bikini Bottom. [The living room is shown. SpongeBob is next to his chair at the table that normally holds the shellphone. He is sitting on a stool. On the table, there is a box of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy Bran Flakes and a Mermaid Man Bowl.] SpongeBob is watching his favorite Saturday morning show: [The scene pans into SpongeBob.] The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [It cuts to a medium shot of the cereal and bowl.] Enjoying a bowl of Mermaid Man [SpongeBob grabs the box and pours in the cereal. The breakfast biters fall out.] and Barnacle Boy Bran Cereal, [SpongeBob tosses the box away and grabs the breakfast biters.] and wearing the official Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy breakfast biters.
TV Announcer: Mermaid Man... [SpongeBob smiles.] fleet [The TV is shown. Mermaid Man is hooked down.] and forceful! [The scene quickly pans into the TV, showing what is on it.] By the power of Neptune. Aided by his young ward... [nothing happens] Aided by his young ward... [Barnacle Boy comes dolling down with a rope attached to him and crashes] ...protecting the sea with feats of strength and agility. [both try to flex their muscles, but break their backs. They both look at each other.]
Mermaid Man: To the chiropractor! Away!
[A live action glove of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy come together and transition to the next scene, which features a spotlight of cardboard cutouts of the Sinister Slug, Atomic Flounder, and Jumbo Shrimp.]
TV Announcer: Fighting a rogues gallery of villains [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy jump into the scene. It then cuts to a close-up of the Sinister Slug cutout.] Like the Sinister Slug, [Barnacle Boy hits it and Pow-bubble with "PROP!" appears. It cuts to a medium shot of the Atomic Flounder cutout.] the Atomic Flounder... [Mermaid Man kicks it and a Pow-bubble with "CARDBOARD!" appears. It cuts to a wide shot of the cut out of the Jumbo Shrimp.] and the dreaded Jumbo Shrimp! [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy punch it. A Pow-bubble with "LAME" appears. It cuts to a medium shot of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy with their rings.] Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy [It cuts to a close-up of the hands joining.] unite! [when the rings unite, sparks appear and then is starts to smoke up. The "Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy" title card appears. Johnny Elaine then appears on a watery background.]
Johnny Elaine: Hey, kids, are you ready to hear the winner of this week's contest?
[The scene cuts to SpongeBob. He grabs his TV.]
SpongeBob: [While shaking his TV.] I'm ready! I'm ready!
[The scene cuts to show a close up of the TV, which has a close up of Johnny Elaine.]
Johnny Elaine: Our winner will receive a special secret collector's [Red question marks appear and fade next to Johnny Elaine's head.] item from The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy! [a small card comes down] And the winner is... [It cuts to SpongeBob, who chatters his teeth. It then cuts back to Johnny Elaine, who is now wearing glasses.] SpringBoob SquirePin.
[The scene cuts back to SpongeBob, who now has Gary next to him.]
SpongeBob: Aw. I worked forever on those life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[The scene cuts back to back to the TV, where Johnny Elaine is in front of the Krabby Patty mannequins.]
Johnny Elaine: ...for these life-size Krabby Patty mannequins of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[The scene cuts back to SpongeBob and Gary.]
SpongeBob: Hey! SpringBoob SquirePin stole my idea!
[The scene cuts back to the TV, where Johnny Elaine is in front of the watery background again.]
Johnny Elaine: [a phone drops and the fish on the other line talks quickly and indistinguishably.] What's that? Oh. It appears I've made a slight error in pronunciation. [It cuts to his full-body.] The real name of the winner is... [It cuts to SpongeBob and Gary.] SpongeBob SquarePants!
[The scene cuts to the exterior of the pineapple.]
SpongeBob: [While the house jumps around] Whahoo! [It cuts to SpongeBob.] Oh, I wonder when my [The scene pans out to show the Newsie Fish, holding a package.] prize will... [SpongeBob notices the fish.] get here... [SpongeBob takes the package.] My prize! [SpongeBob starts to cry and the Newsie fish holds out a tissue box. SpongeBob grabs the tissue and the Newsie fish runs away. SpongeBob kneels down and sets down the box. It tears open the box. He gasps.] Can it be? It is. [The scene changes angles to show the back of SpongeBob, from a distance.] The conch signal. [He turns around and holds up the conch signal.] From The Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [He turns back around and then holds up conch signal again.] As seen on TV. [The scene cuts to a mid-shot of SpongeBob holding the conch signal close to himself.] I wonder if it still works.
[SpongeBob runs to window and blows into it. The scene cuts to the exterior of Shady Shoals as the conch signal continues. It then cuts to Mermaid Man, who is sleeping and Barnacle Boy, sitting on their couch, inside. Mermaid Man wakes up.]
Mermaid Man: The conch signal! [He and Barnacle Boy jump up.] To the Invisible Boatmobile!
[Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy then jump back into their seats. The couch turns around and the run, reveals an underground passage way. The couch's back bends backwards, sending them down a slide.]
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: [While they are sliding.] Ah! Ooh! Oh! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ooh!
[The two then start falling downwards, upright because the slide corrected their position, into the Mermalair. Their butts start to catch fire. The two stop in mid-air, which puts out the fire.]
Barnacle Boy: Uh, Mermaid Man?
Mermaid Man: Yes, Barnacle Boy?
Barnacle Boy: We're not in the Invisible Boatmobile, are we?
Mermaid Man: Uh, Nope.
[The two fall onto the ground and stand up. They walk around, holding out their hands to look for the Invisible Boatmobile.]
Barnacle Boy: I told you making the boatmobile invisible was a stupid idea.
Mermaid Man: Boatmobile! Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Barnacle Boy: It's gotta be here somewhere? [He hits the back of boat] Ow! Oh, Mermaid Man, [While the keys are heard] I think I...
Mermaid Man: [Off-screen] Found it! [He turns on the boat and the back end burns Barnacle Boy.] C'mon, get a move on, son. [As Barnacle Boy walks to the front of the boat.] We don't have all day.
[Barnacle Boy sits down.]
Barnacle Boy: Ignition... [As he pushes a button] on.
Mermaid Man: Throttle... [As he pulls a lever up] on.
[The Invisible Boatmobile goes through a corridor. The exterior of Shady Shoals is shown. The ramp leading to the front goes up, and the Invisible Boatmoble flies out of it. It then goes around a corner. The scene cuts back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Hmm. [He goes back inside to Gary.] Maybe the conch signal doesn't work anymore.
[Gary meows. An entire roaring, then a tire screeching, then a cat screeching are heard outside.]
Mermaid Man: [Off-screen] Activate torpedo mode! Fire! [His head crashes through the wall, next to SpongeBob's door.] Mermaid Man...
[Barnacle Boy's head crashes through the door, causing the wheel on the interior to fall off.]
Barnacle Boy: ...and Bob-acle...
[The door falls on the ground with Barnacle Boy's head still in it.]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it, Gary. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in our home.
[SpongeBob runs to the door and Gary meows. Mermaid Man dusts off Barnacle Boy.]
SpongeBob: Excuse me, I'm...
Mermaid Man: [points at SpongeBob] Oh, my Neptune! He's been horribly disfigured! Oh, blast us! We're too late!
Barnacle Boy: Oh, please. He's not disfigured. He's-he's just that sponge kid again.
Mermaid Man: Oh, yeah. Good to see you, lad. Say, Barnacle Boy, we gotta find out where that conch signal came from.
SpongeBob: Oh, that was me. I blew the conch signal, sir.
Mermaid Man: Alright. Where's the danger, son? Bring it on. Bring it on!
SpongeBob: Don't worry. There's no danger.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: No danger?
Barnacle Boy: Look, there has to be danger. You blew the conch signal. When you blow the... where'd you get that thing anyway?
SpongeBob: I won it in a contest.
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: [Off-screen] Contest?
Mermaid Man: They don't tell us anything anymore.
Barnacle Boy: Look, Spongy, that ain't no toy.
Mermaid Man: That's right. The conch signal is an awesome responsibility. We're duty-bound to help whenever it sounds.
Barnacle Boy: But you only blow it when there's trouble, or there'll be trouble. You got that?
SpongeBob: Yes, sirs!
Mermaid Man: Good boy.
[Mermaid Man pats SpongeBob on the head. He and Barnacle Boy leave. Mermaid Man turns back and he and SpongeBob point at each other and make a clicking noise.]
Barnacle Boy: Come on, come on, [Mermaid Man turns around.] come on. They're serving meatloaf today.
[Mermaid Man walks out the door.]
Mermaid Man: [As he and Barnacle Boy walk away, SpongeBob walks to the door.] Oh, goody.
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mermaid Man. You won't be hearing from me for just anything. Only for the big emergencies.
[The bubble transition goes to the interior of Shady Shoals, where Barnacle Boy, who is wearing a swimsuit, bangs on the bathroom door.]
Barnacle Boy: [While banging on bathroom door] Will you hurry up in there? And save me some hot wat...
[The conch signal is heard. Mermaid Man, who is wearing a towel, kicks down the door, which lands on top of Barnacle Boy.]
Mermaid Man: The conch signal! Come, young ward!
[Mermaid Man runs away.]
Barnacle Boy: [Crushed] Coming!
[Mermaid Man jumps onto the couch. Barnacle Boy, holding his swimsuit, wobbles onto the chair. Because the two entered the couch too quickly, a spring goes back and springs them forward through the rug, down onto the slide. They slide down on their faces first, and Mermaid Man's towel flies off. The whirlpool transition shows a bird's eye-view of SpongeBob's living room. He is laying on the ground with his eyes shut and his tongue out. Gary is next to him. There is also a spot light on him. The tire squealing and the cat shrieking is heard. The angle changes. Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy run into the living room. Mermaid Man stands behind Gary and Barnacle Boy gives Mermaid Man a new towel. Gary crawls away.]
Mermaid Man: Oh... youth! Cut down in its prime! [SpongeBob moans.] Oh, speak to me, son.
[Mermaid Man picks SpongeBob up.]
SpongeBob: Help... Can't... [He lifts a jar of mayo.] open mayonnaise.
Barnacle Boy: What?! [The scene cuts to the front door of the pineapple. The door opens.] [While he is pushing Mermaid Man out the door.] I come down in my underwear to open a jar of mayonnaise?! [He stops and the two turn around.]
SpongeBob: But...
Barnacle Boy: But nothing! We can't go around socializing. We have to be prepared for, uh, emergencies.
Mermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, think about it. Emergencies don't come around as often as they used to.
Barnacle Boy: Alright, okay. You can blow the conch every once in a while. Just give us [He takes the jar of mayo.] something to do when we [while he struggles to open the jar of mayo.] show up.
SpongeBob and Mermaid Man: [While jumping in the air.] Yay!
[The bubble transition goes to the Shady Shoals' cafeteria, where Barnacle Boy is eating soup. The conch signal blows as he grabs a spoon full of soup. He blows on it and Mermaid Man grabs Barnacle Boy's arm, while running, which causes him to drop the spoon.]
Mermaid Man: Danger!
[At SpongeBob's house, in his bathroom, Mermaid Man fixes SpongeBob's sink and Barnacle boy unclogs SpongeBob's shower drain. SpongeBob is shown blowing the conch signal. It then cuts to the library, where Mermaid Man is on a ladder, holding a book, and Mermaid Man is holding Mermaid Man's butt, so that he doesn't fall. SpongeBob is shown blowing the conch signal. It cuts to the living room, where he is in a barber's chair, reading the newspaper, Mermaid Man is shining SpongeBob's shoes, and Barnacle Boy is giving him a head massage. It then cuts to SpongeBob, at night, on his house, using the conch signal. It then cuts to SpongeBob, in bed, next to a teddy bear. Mermaid Man is reading a book and Barnacle Boy is holding milk and plate of cookies. It cuts to SpongeBob blowing the conch signal three different times. On the last time, Barnacle Boy takes it out of SpongeBob's mouth.]
Barnacle Boy: That's it! Gimme that! You're running us ragged.
Mermaid Man: [While crawling on the walkway of SpongeBob's house.] Must... must answer clarion call!
[Mermaid Man collapses.]
Barnacle Boy: We're exhausted!
SpongeBob: [While tearing up] I'm sorry, Barnacle Boy. I didn't mean it. I... just wanted to spend time with you. You're my heroes!
[SpongeBob starts crying.]
Barnacle Boy: [While SpongeBob is crying] It's too late for that, Mr. Contest Winner. I'm gonna destroy this thing with my... sulfur vision! [He tries to uses his sulfur vision to destroy the conch, but is unsuccessful. He tries again, but he still doesn't succeed.] I'll destroy it when I get back to the [Puts the conch in his pocket] , uh, Mermalair. Uh, and as for you...
Mermaid Man: Barnacle Boy, [While getting up.] don't squash his enthusiasm. After all, he could be the hero of tomorrow. Or the villain. Besides, I remember another [He takes out a picture.] young [The image shows Barnacle Boy as a kid.] whipper-snapper, who wanted to be a super-hero.
[Mermaid Man chuckles.]
Barnacle Boy: You don't even remember breakfast, you old coot.
[Mermaid Man walks up to SpongeBob, still crying]
Mermaid Man: Maybe the conch signal is too much responsibility. [SpongeBob stops crying.] But how would you like to spend the rest of the afternoon on patrol?
Barnacle Boy: What?
Mermaid Man: [While he and SpongeBob are running to the Invisible Boatmobile] To the Invisible Boatmobile! [Barnacle Boy becomes angry]
[The scene fades to later. Barnacle Boy is still angry]
SpongeBob: Oh...
SpongeBob and Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells, [Mermaid Man, Barnacle Boy, and SpongeBob, who is now wearing a superhero outfit, is shown in the Invisible Boatmobile, which is driving down the street.] Barnacle Boy laid an egg, The Invisible Boatmobile, [The Invisible Boatmobile stops at a red light.] lost a wheel and...
SpongeBob: Hey, [moves to the driver's seat] can I drive?
Barnacle Boy: Drive? What do you know about driving the Invisible Boatmobile?
SpongeBob: Tons! Like the windshield wipers are right here. [pushes a button]
Barnacle Boy: Don't touch that button, that's the...! [Invisible Boatmobile folds into an origami swan] ...Origami button.
Mermaid Man: [He and Barnacle Boy are scouting on top of a building] When you patrol in the city, you'll always have to be vigilante. On your toes. [Turn to the right side of the building] Constantly alert. Always expect the unexpected. [Turn back to the left of the building. SpongeBob is on the edge]
SpongeBob: Hey! [scares Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and they fall off the building. SpongeBob goes to the rooftop] I've got the doughnuts!
SpongeBob & Mermaid Man: ...and Barnacle Boy laid an egg. Hey-hey!
Mermaid Man: Oh, that fellow over there used to be the Atomic Flounder. I know that he doesn't look like much, but he could go back to crime... [snaps fingers] ...just like that. [he and Barnacle Boy laugh]
Atomic Flounder: [SpongeBob pins the Atomic Flounder on the ground] Help! Help! Help somebody here.
SpongeBob: You're under arrest, Atomic Flounder.
Mermaid Man: Stop, kid. Stop! Let him go.
SpongeBob: But you said he could snap... [snaps fingers] ...just like that.
Atomic Flounder: What?! Get off of me! [pushes SpongeBob away] If I weren't retired, I'd, I'd... [roars, sending out a blast of atomic energy at Barnacle Boy's face. Barnacle Boy's head glows red from radiation, soon blowing up to form a miniature mushroom cloud, leaving his head charred] ...do that. [leaves] Out of my way, punk!
[At The Diner]
SpongeBob: I can't believe it: I rode in the Invisible Boatmobile, met a villain, and learned to treat third-degree burns, all in one day. So, what are we going to do tomorrow.
Barnacle Boy: Uh, uh, say, kid, why don't you take this nickel and go up there and see if our theme song in on the jukebox?
SpongeBob: Okay. [goes to the jukebox]
Mermaid Man: You know, for a pain in the neck, he's a pretty nice kid.
Barnacle Boy: Let's ditch him.
Mermaid Man: I'm right behind you.
SpongeBob: [looking through the selection of songs] It doesn't seem to be here.
Barnacle Boy: Oh, it's there, all right.
Mermaid Man: Keep looking. Diligence. Diligence.
SpongeBob: Aye, aye, sir. [looks again]
Barnacle Boy: Dagnabbit.
Mermaid Man: What's the matter?
Barnacle Boy: Where did we park the Invisible Boatmobile?
SpongeBob: Aw, that's the 15th time I've looked. [deep voice] But I can't let my heroes down. [looks again]
Mermaid Man: Boatmobile, where are you? [tries to find it] Barnacle Boy, I found it. [turns engine on and Barnacle Boy gets burned again]
Dirty Bubble: [laughs] Still getting burned on that tail pipe, huh, Barnacle Boy? [laughs]
Barnacle Boy: It's the Dirty Bubble!
Mermaid Man: In all his dirty roundness!
Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: Oh, no!
SpongeBob: [runs outside] I found it and it's the special dance mix!
Mermaid Man & Barnacle Boy: [trapped inside the Dirty Bubble] Help! Help! Help!
SpongeBob: Holy Krabby Patties! Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy's arch nemesis: The Dirty Bubble! I can't believe it!
Dirty Bubble: [laughs] You cannot save them, Sponge of Mystery! They are trapped by my awesome surface tension! [laughs]
SpongeBob: You don't understand! You're my most favorite super villain. Can I get your autograph? [gets out a notepad and a sharp pencil as the point on the pencil glints]
Dirty Bubble: Oh, no! [Runs away as SpongeBob walks to him while pointing the pencil at him] Oh, no, you fool, stay back! The point. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Watch the point now! [The Dirty Bubble screams when SpongeBob pops the Dirty Bubble with the pencil]
Mermaid Man: Aha! You saved us, son.
Barnacle Boy: Yeah, you're a hero.
SpongeBob: I am?
Mermaid Man: Are you up for another ride in the Invisible Boatmobile?
SpongeBob: Oh...
SpongeBob & Mermaid Man: Jingle bells, Mermaid Man smells, Barnacle Boy laid an egg...
All 3: The Dirty Bubble popped and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and SpongeBob got away! Hooray!
Barnacle Boy: Watch Out! [Short Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy stinger plays]
